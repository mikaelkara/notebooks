# Retrieval Augmentation for GPT-4 using Pinecone

#### Fixing LLMs that Hallucinate

In this notebook we will learn how to query relevant contexts to our queries from Pinecone, and pass these to a GPT-4 model to generate an answer backed by real data sources.

GPT-4 is a big step up from previous OpenAI completion models. It also exclusively uses the `ChatCompletion` endpoint, so we must use it in a slightly different way to usual. However, the power of the model makes the change worthwhile, particularly when augmented with an external knowledge base like the Pinecone vector database.

Required installs for this notebook are:


```python
!pip install -qU bs4 tiktoken openai langchain pinecone-client[grpc]
```

## Preparing the Data

In this example, we will download the LangChain docs from [langchain.readthedocs.io/](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/latest/en/). We get all `.html` files located on the site like so:


```python
!wget -r -A.html -P rtdocs https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/
```




    <Response [200]>



This downloads all HTML into the `rtdocs` directory. Now we can use LangChain itself to process these docs. We do this using the `ReadTheDocsLoader` like so:


```python
from langchain.document_loaders import ReadTheDocsLoader

loader = ReadTheDocsLoader('rtdocs')
docs = loader.load()
len(docs)
```

    .rst .pdf Welcome to LangChain Contents Getting Started Modules Use Cases Reference Docs LangChain Ecosystem Additional Resources Welcome to LangChain# Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. But using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to create a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you are able to combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these types of applications include: ❓ Question Answering over specific documents Documentation End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database 💬 Chatbots Documentation End-to-end Example: Chat-LangChain 🤖 Agents Documentation End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha Getting Started# Checkout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application. Getting Started Documentation Modules# There are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity: Prompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization. LLMs: This includes a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs. Document Loaders: This includes a standard interface for loading documents, as well as specific integrations to all types of text data sources. Utils: Language models are often more powerful when interacting with other sources of knowledge or computation. This can include Python REPLs, embeddings, search engines, and more. LangChain provides a large collection of common utils to use in your application. Chains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications. Indexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that. Agents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents. Memory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory. Chat: Chat models are a variation on Language Models that expose a different API - rather than working with raw text, they work with messages. LangChain provides a standard interface for working with them and doing all the same things as above. Use Cases# The above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports. Agents: Agents are systems that use a language model to interact with other tools. These can be used to do more grounded question/answering, interact with APIs, or even take actions. Chatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots. Data Augmented Generation: Data Augmented Generation involves specific types of chains that first interact with an external datasource to fetch data to use in the generation step. Examples of this include summarization of long pieces of text and question/answering over specific data sources. Question Answering: Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer. A type of Data Augmented Generation. Summarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation. Evaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this. Generate similar examples: Generating similar examples to a given input. This is a common use case for many applications, and LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this. Compare models: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so. Reference Docs# All of LangChain’s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation on all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for LangChain. Reference Documentation LangChain Ecosystem# Guides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain LangChain Ecosystem Additional Resources# Additional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your application! LangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents. Glossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not! Gallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications. Deployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps. Discord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain! Tracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents. Production Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we’d love to offer more comprehensive support.

This leaves us with hundreds of processed doc pages. Let's take a look at the format each one contains:


```python
docs[0]
```

We access the plaintext page content like so:


```python
print(docs[0].page_content)
```


```python
print(docs[5].page_content)
```

We can also find the source of each document:


```python
docs[5].metadata['source'].replace('rtdocs/', 'https://')
```

We can use these to create our `data` list:


```python
data = []

for doc in docs:
    data.append({
        'url': doc.metadata['source'].replace('rtdocs/', 'https://'),
        'text': doc.page_content
    })
```


```python

It's pretty ugly but it's good enough for now. Let's see how we can process all of these. We will chunk everything into ~400 token chunks, we can do this easily with `langchain` and `tiktoken`:


```python
import tiktoken

tokenizer = tiktoken.get_encoding('p50k_base')

# create the length function
def tiktoken_len(text):
    tokens = tokenizer.encode(
        text,
        disallowed_special=()
    )
    return len(tokens)
```


```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=400,
    chunk_overlap=20,
    length_function=tiktoken_len,
    separators=["\n\n", "\n", " ", ""]
)
```

Process the `data` into more chunks using this approach.


```python
from uuid import uuid4
from tqdm.auto import tqdm

chunks = []

for idx, record in enumerate(tqdm(data)):
    texts = text_splitter.split_text(record['text'])
    chunks.extend([{
        'id': str(uuid4()),
        'text': texts[i],
        'chunk': i,
        'url': record['url']
    } for i in range(len(texts))])
```


      0%|          | 0/231 [00:00<?, ?it/s]


Our chunks are ready so now we move onto embedding and indexing everything.

## Initialize Embedding Model

We use `text-embedding-3-small` as the embedding model. We can embed text like so:


```python
import openai

# initialize openai API key
openai.api_key = "sk-..."

embed_model = "text-embedding-3-small"

res = openai.Embedding.create(
    input=[
        "Sample document text goes here",
        "there will be several phrases in each batch"
    ], engine=embed_model
)
```

In the response `res` we will find a JSON-like object containing our new embeddings within the `'data'` field.


```python
res.keys()
```




    dict_keys(['object', 'data', 'model', 'usage'])



Inside `'data'` we will find two records, one for each of the two sentences we just embedded. Each vector embedding contains `1536` dimensions (the output dimensionality of the `text-embedding-3-small` model.


```python
len(res['data'])
```




    2




```python
len(res['data'][0]['embedding']), len(res['data'][1]['embedding'])
```




    (1536, 1536)



We will apply this same embedding logic to the langchain docs dataset we've just scraped. But before doing so we must create a place to store the embeddings.

## Initializing the Index

Now we need a place to store these embeddings and enable a efficient vector search through them all. To do that we use Pinecone, we can get a [free API key](https://app.pinecone.io/) and enter it below where we will initialize our connection to Pinecone and create a new index.


```python
import pinecone

index_name = 'gpt-4-langchain-docs'

# initialize connection to pinecone
pinecone.init(
    api_key="PINECONE_API_KEY",  # app.pinecone.io (console)
    environment="PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT"  # next to API key in console
)

# check if index already exists (it shouldn't if this is first time)
if index_name not in pinecone.list_indexes():
    # if does not exist, create index
    pinecone.create_index(
        index_name,
        dimension=len(res['data'][0]['embedding']),
        metric='dotproduct'
    )
# connect to index
index = pinecone.GRPCIndex(index_name)
# view index stats
index.describe_index_stats()
```




    {'dimension': 1536,
     'index_fullness': 0.0,
     'namespaces': {},
     'total_vector_count': 0}



We can see the index is currently empty with a `total_vector_count` of `0`. We can begin populating it with OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` built embeddings like so:


```python
from tqdm.auto import tqdm
import datetime
from time import sleep

batch_size = 100  # how many embeddings we create and insert at once

for i in tqdm(range(0, len(chunks), batch_size)):
    # find end of batch
    i_end = min(len(chunks), i+batch_size)
    meta_batch = chunks[i:i_end]
    # get ids
    ids_batch = [x['id'] for x in meta_batch]
    # get texts to encode
    texts = [x['text'] for x in meta_batch]
    # create embeddings (try-except added to avoid RateLimitError)
    try:
        res = openai.Embedding.create(input=texts, engine=embed_model)
    except:
        done = False
        while not done:
            sleep(5)
            try:
                res = openai.Embedding.create(input=texts, engine=embed_model)
                done = True
            except:
                pass
    embeds = [record['embedding'] for record in res['data']]
    # cleanup metadata
    meta_batch = [{
        'text': x['text'],
        'chunk': x['chunk'],
        'url': x['url']
    } for x in meta_batch]
    to_upsert = list(zip(ids_batch, embeds, meta_batch))
    # upsert to Pinecone
    index.upsert(vectors=to_upsert)
```


      0%|          | 0/12 [00:00<?, ?it/s]


Now we've added all of our langchain docs to the index. With that we can move on to retrieval and then answer generation using GPT-4.

## Retrieval

To search through our documents we first need to create a query vector `xq`. Using `xq` we will retrieve the most relevant chunks from the LangChain docs, like so:


```python
query = "how do I use the LLMChain in LangChain?"

res = openai.Embedding.create(
    input=[query],
    engine=embed_model
)

# retrieve from Pinecone
xq = res['data'][0]['embedding']

# get relevant contexts (including the questions)
res = index.query(xq, top_k=5, include_metadata=True)
```


```python
res
```

With retrieval complete, we move on to feeding these into GPT-4 to produce answers.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation

GPT-4 is currently accessed via the `ChatCompletions` endpoint of OpenAI. To add the information we retrieved into the model, we need to pass it into our user prompts *alongside* our original query. We can do that like so:


```python
# get list of retrieved text
contexts = [item['metadata']['text'] for item in res['matches']]

augmented_query = "\n\n---\n\n".join(contexts)+"\n\n-----\n\n"+query
```


```python
print(augmented_query)
```

Query an LLM with the LLMChain Combine chains with the SequentialChain Create a custom chain with the Chain class Getting Started# In this tutorial, we will learn about creating simple chains in LangChain. We will learn how to create a chain, add components to it, and run it. In this tutorial, we will cover: Using a simple LLM chain Creating sequential chains Creating a custom chain Why do we need chains?# Chains allow us to combine multiple components together to create a single, coherent application. For example, we can create a chain that takes user input, formats it with a PromptTemplate, and then passes the formatted response to an LLM. We can build more complex chains by combining multiple chains together, or by combining chains with other components. Query an LLM with the LLMChain# The LLMChain is a simple chain that takes in a prompt template, formats it with the user input and returns the response from an LLM. To use the LLMChain, first create a prompt template. from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.llms import OpenAI llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9) prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=["product"], template="What is a good

    chain first uses a LLM to construct the url to hit, then makes that request with the Requests wrapper, and finally runs that result through the language model again in order to product a natural language response. Example Notebook LLMBash Chain Links Used: BashProcess, LLMChain Notes: This chain takes user input (a question), uses an LLM chain to convert it to a bash command to run in the terminal, and then returns that as the result. Example Notebook LLMChecker Chain Links Used: LLMChain Notes: This chain takes user input (a question), uses an LLM chain to answer that question, and then uses other LLMChains to self-check that answer. Example Notebook LLMRequests Chain Links Used: Requests, LLMChain Notes: This chain takes a URL and other inputs, uses Requests to get the data at that URL, and then passes that along with the other inputs into an LLMChain to generate a response. The example included shows how to ask a question to Google - it firsts constructs a Google url, then fetches the data there, then passes that data + the original question into an LLMChain to get an answer.

    how do I use the LLMChain in LangChain?
    

Now we ask the question:


```python
# system message to 'prime' the model
primer = f"""You are Q&A bot. A highly intelligent system that answers
user questions based on the information provided by the user above
each question. If the information can not be found in the information
provided by the user you truthfully say "I don't know".
"""

res = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": primer},
        {"role": "user", "content": augmented_query}
    ]
)
```

To display this response nicely, we will display it in markdown.


```python
from IPython.display import Markdown

display(Markdown(res['choices'][0]['message']['content']))
```


To use the LLMChain in LangChain, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary classes:
```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
```

2. Create an instance of the LLM and set the configuration options:
```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9)
```

3. Create a PromptTemplate instance with the input variables and the template:
```python
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["product"],
    template="What is a good product for {product}?",
)
```

4. Create an LLMChain instance by passing the LLM and PromptTemplate instances:
```python
llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt_template=prompt)
```

5. Run the LLMChain with user input:
```python
response = llm_chain.run({"product": "software development"})
```

6. Access the generated response:
```python
generated_text = response["generated_text"]
```

In this example, the LLMChain is used to generate a response by passing through the user input and formatting it using the prompt template. The response is then obtained from the LLM instance (in this case, OpenAI), and the generated text can be accessed from the response dictionary.


Let's compare this to a non-augmented query...


```python
res = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": primer},
        {"role": "user", "content": query}
    ]
)
display(Markdown(res['choices'][0]['message']['content']))
```


I don't know.


If we drop the `"I don't know"` part of the `primer`?


```python
res = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are Q&A bot. A highly intelligent system that answers user questions"},
        {"role": "user", "content": query}
    ]
)
display(Markdown(res['choices'][0]['message']['content']))
```
