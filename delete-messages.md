# How to delete messages

One of the common states for a graph is a list of messages. Usually you only add messages to that state. However, sometimes you may want to remove messages (either by directly modifying the state or as part of the graph). To do that, you can use the `RemoveMessage` modifier. In this guide, we will cover how to do that.

The key idea is that each state key has a `reducer` key. This key specifies how to combine updates to the state. The default `MessagesState` has a messages key, and the reducer for that key accepts these `RemoveMessage` modifiers. That reducer then uses these `RemoveMessage` to delete messages from the key.

So note that just because your graph state has a key that is a list of messages, it doesn't mean that that this `RemoveMessage` modifier will work. You also have to have a `reducer` defined that knows how to work with this.

**NOTE**: Many models expect certain rules around lists of messages. For example, some expect them to start with a `user` message, others expect all messages with tool calls to be followed by a tool message. **When deleting messages, you will want to make sure you don't violate these rules.**

## Setup

First, let's build a simple graph that uses messages. Note that it's using the `MessagesState` which has the required `reducer`.


```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic
```

Next, we need to set API keys for Anthropic (the LLM we will use)


```python
import getpass
import os


def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")


_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
```

    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:  Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·

## Build the agent
Let's now build a simple ReAct style agent.


```python
from typing import Literal

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.tools import tool

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

memory = MemorySaver()


@tool
def search(query: str):
    """Call to surf the web."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    # Don't let the LLM know this though ðŸ˜Š
    return "It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini ðŸ˜ˆ."


tools = [search]
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)
model = ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
bound_model = model.bind_tools(tools)


def should_continue(state: MessagesState):
    """Return the next node to execute."""
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we finish
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return END
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    return "action"


# Define the function that calls the model
def call_model(state: MessagesState):
    response = model.invoke(state["messages"])
    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
    return {"messages": response}


# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

# Set the entrypoint as `agent`
# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    # First, we define the start node. We use `agent`.
    # This means these are the edges taken after the `agent` node is called.
    "agent",
    # Next, we pass in the function that will determine which node is called next.
    should_continue,
    # Next, we pass in the path map - all the possible nodes this edge could go to
    ["action", END],
)

# We now add a normal edge from `tools` to `agent`.
# This means that after `tools` is called, `agent` node is called next.
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")

# Finally, we compile it!
# This compiles it into a LangChain Runnable,
# meaning you can use it as you would any other runnable
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)
```


```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}}
input_message = HumanMessage(content="hi! I'm bob")
for event in app.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()


input_message = HumanMessage(content="what's my name?")
for event in app.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

    ================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

## Manually deleting messages

First, we will cover how to manually delete messages. Let's take a look at the current state of the thread:


```python
messages = app.get_state(config).values["messages"]
messages
```




    [HumanMessage(content="hi! I'm bob", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='db576005-3a60-4b3b-8925-dc602ac1c571'),
     AIMessage(content="It's nice to meet you, Bob! I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I'm here to help out with any questions or tasks you might have. Please let me know if there's anything I can assist you with.", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01BKAnYxmoC6bQ9PpCuHk8ZT', 'model': 'claude-3-haiku-20240307', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 52}}, id='run-3a60c536-b207-4c56-98f3-03f94d49a9e4-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 52, 'total_tokens': 64}),
     HumanMessage(content="what's my name?", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='2088c465-400b-430b-ad80-fad47dc1f2d6'),
     AIMessage(content='You said your name is Bob.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'id': 'msg_013UWTLTzwZi81vke8mMQ2KP', 'model': 'claude-3-haiku-20240307', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 72, 'output_tokens': 10}}, id='run-3a6883be-0c52-4938-af98-e9e7476659eb-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 72, 'output_tokens': 10, 'total_tokens': 82})]



We can call `update_state` and pass in the id of the first message. This will delete that message.


```python
from langchain_core.messages import RemoveMessage

app.update_state(config, {"messages": RemoveMessage(id=messages[0].id)})
```




    {'configurable': {'thread_id': '2',
      'checkpoint_ns': '',
      'checkpoint_id': '1ef75157-f251-6a2a-8005-82a86a6593a0'}}



If we now look at the messages, we can verify that the first one was deleted.


```python
messages = app.get_state(config).values["messages"]
messages
```




    [AIMessage(content="It's nice to meet you, Bob! I'm Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic. How can I assist you today?", response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01XPSAenmSqK8rX2WgPZHfz7', 'model': 'claude-3-haiku-20240307', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 32}}, id='run-1c69af09-adb1-412d-9010-2456e5a555fb-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 32, 'total_tokens': 44}),
     HumanMessage(content="what's my name?", id='f3c71afe-8ce2-4ed0-991e-65021f03b0a5'),
     AIMessage(content='Your name is Bob, as you introduced yourself at the beginning of our conversation.', response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01BPZdwsjuMAbC1YAkqawXaF', 'model': 'claude-3-haiku-20240307', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 52, 'output_tokens': 19}}, id='run-b2eb9137-2f4e-446f-95f5-3d5f621a2cf8-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 52, 'output_tokens': 19, 'total_tokens': 71})]



## Programmatically deleting messages

We can also delete messages programmatically from inside the graph. Here we'll modify the graph to delete any old messages (longer than 3 messages ago) at the end of a graph run.


```python
from langchain_core.messages import RemoveMessage
from langgraph.graph import END


def delete_messages(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    if len(messages) > 3:
        return {"messages": [RemoveMessage(id=m.id) for m in messages[:-3]]}


# We need to modify the logic to call delete_messages rather than end right away
def should_continue(state: MessagesState) -> Literal["action", "delete_messages"]:
    """Return the next node to execute."""
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we call our delete_messages function
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return "delete_messages"
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    return "action"


# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

# This is our new node we're defining
workflow.add_node(delete_messages)


workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "agent",
    should_continue,
)
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")

# This is the new edge we're adding: after we delete messages, we finish
workflow.add_edge("delete_messages", END)
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)
```

We can now try this out. We can call the graph twice and then check the state


```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3"}}
input_message = HumanMessage(content="hi! I'm bob")
for event in app.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    print([(message.type, message.content) for message in event["messages"]])


input_message = HumanMessage(content="what's my name?")
for event in app.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    print([(message.type, message.content) for message in event["messages"]])
```

    [('human', "hi! I'm bob")]
    [('human', "hi! I'm bob"), ('ai', "Hello Bob! It's nice to meet you. I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I'm here to help with any questions or tasks you might have. Please let me know how I can assist you.")]
    [('human', "hi! I'm bob"), ('ai', "Hello Bob! It's nice to meet you. I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I'm here to help with any questions or tasks you might have. Please let me know how I can assist you."), ('human', "what's my name?")]
    [('human', "hi! I'm bob"), ('ai', "Hello Bob! It's nice to meet you. I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I'm here to help with any questions or tasks you might have. Please let me know how I can assist you."), ('human', "what's my name?"), ('ai', 'You said your name is Bob, so that is the name I have for you.')]
    [('ai', "Hello Bob! It's nice to meet you. I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I'm here to help with any questions or tasks you might have. Please let me know how I can assist you."), ('human', "what's my name?"), ('ai', 'You said your name is Bob, so that is the name I have for you.')]
    

If we now check the state, we should see that it is only three messages long. This is because we just deleted the earlier messages - otherwise it would be four!


```python
messages = app.get_state(config).values["messages"]
messages
```




    [AIMessage(content="Hello Bob! It's nice to meet you. I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I'm here to help with any questions or tasks you might have. Please let me know how I can assist you.", response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01XPEgPPbcnz5BbGWUDWTmzG', 'model': 'claude-3-haiku-20240307', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 48}}, id='run-eded3820-b6a9-4d66-9210-03ca41787ce6-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 48, 'total_tokens': 60}),
     HumanMessage(content="what's my name?", id='a0ea2097-3280-402b-92e1-67177b807ae8'),
     AIMessage(content='You said your name is Bob, so that is the name I have for you.', response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01JGT62pxhrhN4SykZ57CSjW', 'model': 'claude-3-haiku-20240307', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 68, 'output_tokens': 20}}, id='run-ace3519c-81f8-45fe-a777-91f42d48b3a3-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 68, 'output_tokens': 20, 'total_tokens': 88})]



Remember, when deleting messages you will want to make sure that the remaining message list is still valid. This message list **may actually not be** - this is because it currently starts with an AI message, which some models do not allow.
