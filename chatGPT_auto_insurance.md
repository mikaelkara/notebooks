# Building an auto insurance chatbot using Azure OpenAI ChatGPT

### Problem description
    Build an Auto insurance chatbot to help users by answering their questions about auto insurance plans and providing personalized recommendations based on the user account information.

    Within the chatbot workflow, this model is placed after the topic classifier (which distinguishes the topic of a user input), and is only responsible for handling user utterances that are relevant to auto insurance questions.
### Background
    The chatbot is for an insurance company called Contoso, Ltd.
    The chatbot has access to relevant FAQ knowledge base on auto insurance, as well as customers information.
    
    An example on customer information shown below:
        Insurer's Name: Dave Huang
        Membership Start Date: March 2019
        Auto Insurance: Yes
        Auto Insurance Deductible: $500 per incident
        Auto Insurance Claims history: auto accident in Jan 2020; auto accident in Apr 2022 
        Safe Driver Rating: 22 of 100
        Home Insurance: No
        Flood Insurance: No
        Home Address: 100 Main Street, Seattle, WA
        Flood Risk Factor: 8 of 10
        Bundling Discount: No
        Safe Driver Discount: No
            
### Approach
    The model is built using Azure OpenAI ChatGPT-turbo base model, relevant information (insurance knowledge and user account information) is provided in the system prompt.

### Result
    The chatbot is working as expected, it can provide personalized answers based on knowledge base and user account information. A few manual evaluation examples on two user accounts are included.

**note**: This notebook is built using the March 2023 version of ChatGPT (gpt-35-turbo). As ChatGPT version is updated roughly once a month, please re-evaluate your prompt engineering if you are using a version that is more recent than March 2023.

    What are some ways for me to lower my insurance premium?
    ---------------
    There are several ways to lower your insurance premium. Let's go through each one and see which ones apply to you based on your User Account Information. 
    
    1. Bundling Discount: If you have more than one insurance plan with Contoso, you may be eligible for a bundling discount. Since you currently don't have a bundling discount, I recommend considering adding another insurance plan with Contoso to save money on both plans.
    
    2. Increase Deductible: The higher your deductible, the lower your premium will be. Your current deductible is $500 per incident, which is the average. If you're comfortable with a higher deductible, increasing it could help lower your premium.
    
    3. Safe Driver Discount: Maintaining a high safe driver score can make you eligible for a discount. Your safe driver rating is 22 of 100, which is below the threshold for a discount. I recommend focusing on improving your driving habits to increase your rating and become eligible for this discount.
    
    4. Driving Habit Tracking Device Discount: Installing a driving habit tracking device in your vehicle can also make you eligible for a discount. Currently, you don't have this device installed in your vehicle, but it may be worth considering if it could help lower your premium.
    
    Remember that these are just some ways to potentially lower your premium and may not apply to everyone's situation. Is there anything else I can help you with?
    ---------------
    Can you tell me more about bundling?
    ---------------
    Certainly! Bundling is when you have more than one insurance plan with Contoso. For example, if you have both auto insurance and home insurance with Contoso, you may be eligible for a bundling discount. This discount can help lower your premium on both plans.
    
    Bundling can also make managing your insurance plans easier since you only have to deal with one company for multiple policies. Additionally, bundling can provide more comprehensive coverage since some policies may overlap and provide extra protection.
    
    If you're interested in bundling your insurance plans, I recommend speaking with a Contoso representative to see what options are available to you based on your specific needs and circumstances.
    ---------------
    Thank you for the detailed explanation. I would like to get a quote with bundling auto and home insurance
    ---------------
    I'm glad I could help! As an auto insurance agent, I don't have access to the quoting system. However, I can connect you with a quote specialist at Contoso who can assist you further. Please hold while I connect you.
