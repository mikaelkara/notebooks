    1. **Software Engineer** at TechCorp
       - **Required Skills**: Python, JavaScript, RESTful APIs
       - **Key Responsibilities**: Develop and maintain software applications, collaborate with cross-functional teams, ensure code quality
       - **Match Evaluation**:
         - The candidate has strong experience in Python and JavaScript, having developed and maintained web applications using these technologies.
         - The candidate has also collaborated with cross-functional teams and ensured code quality, which aligns with the job responsibilities.
    
    2. **Data Scientist** at DataTech
       - **Required Skills**: Python, R, Machine Learning, Data Analysis
       - **Key Responsibilities**: Analyze large datasets to extract insights, build predictive models, collaborate with stakeholders
       - **Match Evaluation**:
         - The candidate has Python experience but does not have skills in R, Machine Learning, or Data Analysis, which are crucial for this role. Therefore, the match is low.
    
    3. **Project Manager** at ProjectPlus
       - **Required Skills**: Agile, Scrum, Leadership, Communication
       - **Key Responsibilities**: Manage project timelines, coordinate with team members, ensure project goals are met
       - **Match Evaluation**:
         - The candidate does not have direct project management experience or specific skills in Agile or Scrum, making this role a poor fit.
    
    4. **DevOps Engineer** at DevOpsCo
       - **Required Skills**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD
       - **Key Responsibilities**: Implement and manage CI/CD pipelines, automate deployment processes, monitor system performance
       - **Match Evaluation**:
         - The candidate has experience with Docker and has implemented a CI/CD pipeline, which aligns well with this position. However, there is no mention of Kubernetes experience, which may be a requirement.
    
    5. **Marketing Specialist** at MarketGenius
       - **Required Skills**: SEO, Content Creation, Social Media
       - **Key Responsibilities**: Develop and execute marketing campaigns, create content for various platforms, analyze campaign performance
       - **Match Evaluation**:
         - The candidateâ€™s background is unrelated to marketing, thus making this position an unsuitable match.
    
    Based on this analysis, I will now assign a match score to each job based on the alignment of the candidate's skills and experiences to the job requirements.
    
    Thought: I will now compile the ranked list of job opportunities that best match the CV, including job titles, match scores, and key matching points.
