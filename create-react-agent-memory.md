This guide will show how to add memory to the prebuilt ReAct agent. Please see [this tutorial](../create-react-agent) for how to get started with the prebuilt ReAct agent

We can add memory to the agent, by passing a [checkpointer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/) to the [create_react_agent](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/prebuilt/#langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor.create_react_agent) function.

## Setup

First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys


```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-openai
```


```python
import getpass
import os


def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")


_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

## Code


```python
# First we initialize the model we want to use.
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)


# For this tutorial we will use custom tool that returns pre-defined values for weather in two cities (NYC & SF)

from typing import Literal

from langchain_core.tools import tool


@tool
def get_weather(city: Literal["nyc", "sf"]):
    """Use this to get weather information."""
    if city == "nyc":
        return "It might be cloudy in nyc"
    elif city == "sf":
        return "It's always sunny in sf"
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Unknown city")


tools = [get_weather]

# We can add "chat memory" to the graph with LangGraph's checkpointer
# to retain the chat context between interactions
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

memory = MemorySaver()

# Define the graph

from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=memory)
```

## Usage

Let's interact with it multiple times to show that it can remember


```python
def print_stream(stream):
    for s in stream:
        message = s["messages"][-1]
        if isinstance(message, tuple):
            print(message)
        else:
            message.pretty_print()
```


```python
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
inputs = {"messages": [("user", "What's the weather in NYC?")]}

print_stream(graph.stream(inputs, config=config, stream_mode="values"))
```

    ================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================
    
    What's the weather in NYC?
    ==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
    Tool Calls:
      get_weather (call_xM1suIq26KXvRFqJIvLVGfqG)
     Call ID: call_xM1suIq26KXvRFqJIvLVGfqG
      Args:
        city: nyc
    =================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================
    Name: get_weather
    
    It might be cloudy in nyc
    ==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
    
    The weather in NYC might be cloudy.
    

Notice that when we pass the same the same thread ID, the chat history is preserved


```python
inputs = {"messages": [("user", "What's it known for?")]}
print_stream(graph.stream(inputs, config=config, stream_mode="values"))
```

    ================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================
