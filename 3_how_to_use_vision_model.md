# Vision Models

Vision models can look at pictures and then tell you what's in them using words. These are called vision-to-text models. They bring together the power of understanding images and language. Using fancy neural networks, these models can look at pictures and describe them in a way that makes sense. They're like a bridge between what you see and what you can read. 

This is super useful for things like making captions for images, helping people who can't see well understand what's in a picture, and organizing information. As these models get even smarter, they're going to make computers even better at understanding and talking about what they "see" in pictures. It's like teaching computers to understand and describe the visual world around us.

**Note**: 
To run any of these relevant notebooks you will need an account on Anyscale Endpoints, Anthropic, or OpenAI, depending on what model you elect, along with the respective environment file. Use the template environment files to create respective `.env` file for either Anyscale Endpoints, Anthropic, or OpenAI.


```python
import warnings
import os

import openai
from openai import OpenAI

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
from typing import List
```

Load the environment


```python
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
openai.api_base = os.getenv("ANYSCALE_API_BASE", os.getenv("OPENAI_API_BASE"))
openai.api_key = os.getenv("ANYSCALE_API_KEY", os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
MODEL = os.getenv("MODEL")
print(f"Using MODEL={MODEL}; base={openai.api_base}")
```

    Using MODEL=gpt-4-1106-preview; base=https://api.openai.com/v1
    

#### Change the model to use gpt-4-vision-preview!


```python
MODEL = "gpt-4-vision-preview"
```


```python
# create the OpenAI client, which can be used transparently with Anyscale Endpoints too

from openai import OpenAI

    api_key = openai.api_key,
    base_url = openai.api_base

    Image description: The picture captures a narrow alleyway in what appears to be a market setting, likely within a country that has cultural ties to textile crafts and possibly a Mediterranean or Middle Eastern influence based on the style of the goods and signage. The alley is lined with a variety of colorful rugs and textiles, displayed hanging on the walls on either side. The textiles feature intricate patterns and designs, suggesting a traditional art style that may be indicative of the region's heritage and craftsmanship.
    
    The buildings are white with a simple architectural style, possibly plastered, which is characteristic of many Mediterranean and North African countries to reflect sunlight and keep the interiors cool. The sky is bright and clear, suggesting a sunny and warm climate. The ground is paved with rectangular grey tiles, and the alley seems clean and well-maintained.
    
    There are signs hung above in the alley. One sign reads "Ristorante cucina tipica," which is Italian for "Restaurant typical cuisine," indicating that there might be an Italian restaurant nearby offering traditional dishes. Another sign, partially visible, includes the words "dar habiba restaurant," which likely points to another dining establishment named Dar Habiba, which may suggest an Arabic influence or setting.
    
    No individuals are visible in the image, so the focus remains on the cultural and commercial aspects of the alley. The combination of the displayed textiles, the architecture, and the signage suggests a tourist-friendly area that celebrates traditional local art and cuisine. Based on these details, the setting could be in a country like Morocco, Tunisia, or another place where markets like these are common and where there is a blend of Mediterranean and local cultural elements.

    Image description: This is an aerial or high-altitude image of a dense urban skyline during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset, given the warm golden and orange hues in the sky and the long shadows cast by the buildings. The skyline is characterized by numerous skyscrapers of varying heights, tightly packed together, creating a sense of a bustling metropolis. In the foreground, one of the buildings prominently displays the "MetLife" logo, suggesting the presence of corporate offices.
    
    The body of water to the right of the image, along with the configuration of the buildings, suggests that this could be a view of Manhattan in New York City, USA. The river is likely the East River, and the landmass across the river could be the borough of Queens or Brooklyn. The lighting and the color saturation give the photograph a dramatic and perhaps slightly stylized appearance, enhancing the contrast and depth of the cityscape.
    
    There are no overt indications of an art style applied to the photo, but there is evidence of post-processing to enhance the colors and possibly to add a soft glow to the light sources. The photograph is likely taken from a very high vantage point, possibly from another skyscraper or a drone.
    
    The signs, like the MetLife logo, indicate the presence of major businesses and the commercial nature of the area. The MetLife Building is a well-known landmark in New York City, which further reinforces the identification of the location. No other specific signs can be discerned from this perspective, but generally, such signs suggest a developed, economically active urban environment.
