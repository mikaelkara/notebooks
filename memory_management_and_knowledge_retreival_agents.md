    To identify a specific user and formulate a query for searching memories, you can refer to the User Memories Resource from FamilySearch.org. The relevant details include:
    
    - **Identifying a User**: You can use the user ID provided by the Common Identify Service (CIS) to identify a user.
    - **Query Parameters**:
      - **count**: This parameter allows you to specify the maximum number of artifacts (memories) belonging to the user to be returned. If not specified, all memories will be returned (minimum value is 1).
      - **start**: This parameter sets the index (zero-based) of the first artifact to return. The default is 0 (minimum value is 0).

The gathered results mention methods for finding Security Identifiers (SIDs) and usernames, which might be relevant for searching memories. I will summarize the information for clarity.
    
    Final Answer: 
    To identify a user ID and search for specific memories, you can follow these approaches:
    
    1. **Using Registry Editor**: Open the Registry Editor and navigate to:
       ```
       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList
       ```
       Here, you will see the Security Identifiers (SIDs) of users. Each SID corresponds to a user profile which can help you find the associated user ID.
    
    2. **Using WMIC**: You can use the Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line (WMIC) to find a user's SID. This can be done by running the command:
       ```
       wmic useraccount get name,sid
       ```
       This will display all user accounts along with their SIDs.
    
    3. **PowerShell**: You can create a drive for HKEY_USERS and list the SIDs by executing:
       ```powershell
       New-PSDrive -PSProvider Registry -Name HKU -Root HKEY_USERS -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
       ```
       This allows you to explore the user SIDs and find relevant information.
    
    4. **Online Resources**:
       - [Getting the Username from the HKEY_USERS values](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2919286/getting-the-username-from-the-hkey-users-values)
       - [Find Security Identifier (SID) of any User](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/find-security-identifier-sid-of-any-user)
       - [How to know SID of Windows' user account?](https://superuser.com/questions/231908/how-to-know-sid-of-windows-user-account)
    
    Using these methods, you can identify the user ID and retrieve the necessary information to search for specific memories.[0m

    To identify a user ID and search for specific memories, you can follow these approaches:
    
    1. **Using Registry Editor**: Open the Registry Editor and navigate to:
       ```
       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList
       ```
       Here, you will see the Security Identifiers (SIDs) of users. Each SID corresponds to a user profile which can help you find the associated user ID.
    
    2. **Using WMIC**: You can use the Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line (WMIC) to find a user's SID. This can be done by running the command:
       ```
       wmic useraccount get name,sid
       ```
       This will display all user accounts along with their SIDs.
    
    3. **PowerShell**: You can create a drive for HKEY_USERS and list the SIDs by executing:
       ```powershell
       New-PSDrive -PSProvider Registry -Name HKU -Root HKEY_USERS -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
       ```
       This allows you to explore the user SIDs and find relevant information.
    
    4. **Online Resources**:
       - [Getting the Username from the HKEY_USERS values](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2919286/getting-the-username-from-the-hkey-users-values)
       - [Find Security Identifier (SID) of any User](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/find-security-identifier-sid-of-any-user)
       - [How to know SID of Windows' user account?](https://superuser.com/questions/231908/how-to-know-sid-of-windows-user-account)
    
    Using these methods, you can identify the user ID and retrieve the necessary information to search for specific memories.
