## Before you begin

### Set up your Google Cloud project

**The following steps are required, regardless of your notebook environment.**

1. [Select or create a Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager). When you first create an account, you get a $300 free credit towards your compute/storage costs.
1. [Make sure that billing is enabled for your project](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project).
1. Enable the [Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com).
1. If you are running this notebook locally, you need to install the [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk).

### Installation

Install the following packages required to execute this notebook.


```
%pip install --upgrade --user --quiet google-cloud-aiplatform
```

Restart the kernel after installing packages:


```
import IPython

app = IPython.Application.instance()
app.kernel.do_shutdown(True)
```

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>‚ö†Ô∏è The kernel is going to restart. Please wait until it is finished before continuing to the next step. ‚ö†Ô∏è</b>
</div>

### Authenticate your Google Cloud account

If you are running this notebook on Google Colab, you will need to authenticate your environment. To do this, run the new cell below. This step is not required if you are using Vertex AI Workbench.


```
import sys

if "google.colab" in sys.modules:
    # Authenticate user to Google Cloud
    from google.colab import auth

    auth.authenticate_user()
```

### Set Google Cloud project information and initialize Vertex AI SDK

To get started using Vertex AI, you must have an existing Google Cloud project and [enable the Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com).

Learn more about [setting up a project and a development environment](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/cloud-environment).

**If you don't know your project ID**, try the following:
* Run `gcloud config list`.
* Run `gcloud projects list`.
* See the support page: [Locate the project ID](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/7014113)

You can also change the `REGION` variable used by Vertex AI. Learn more about [Vertex AI regions](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/locations).


```
# TODO (Developer): Replace with your project ID

PROJECT_ID = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"  # @param {type:"string"}
REGION = "us-central1"  # @param {type: "string"}
```

Initialize the Vertex AI Python SDK for your project:


```
import vertexai

vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=REGION)
```

### Import libraries


```
from IPython.display import Markdown, display
from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel, Part
```

Initialize the Gemini model from Vertex AI:


```
model = GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash")
```

## Creating visual asset for various platforms

You can also create more visual assets for various platform using Imagen. For example, you might want to use 16:9 aspect ratio image instead of 1:1 aspect ratio image that you just used. Here you will use [outpainting feature](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/image/edit-outpainting#generativeaionvertexai_imagen_edit_image_outpainting_mask-python_vertex_ai_sdk) from Imagen to expend the 1:1 aspect ratio to 16:9.


Note: To complete the following part, you need to be allowlisted for Imagen's features. To request access to use the Imagen features, fill out the [Imagen on Vertex AI access request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cqt9padvfMgqn23W5FMPTqh7bW1KLkEOsC5G6uC-uuM/viewform).
