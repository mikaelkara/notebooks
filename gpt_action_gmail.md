# GPT Action Library: Gmail

## Introduction

This page provides an instruction & guide for developers building a GPT Action for a specific application. Before you proceed, make sure to first familiarize yourself with the following information: 
- [Introduction to GPT Actions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions)
- [Introduction to GPT Actions Library](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/actions-library)
- [Example of Building a GPT Action from Scratch](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/getting-started)

This GPT Action provides an overview of how to connect to Google Gmail, Google’s Private & Secure Email for Personal or Business. This Action is connected to the Google Gmail APIs that can read, send, list, and draft emails in the authorized account. 

### Value + Example Business Use Cases

**Value**: The Gmail GPT will serve as a powerful tool to streamline communication processes, improve customer engagement, and optimize resource allocation.

**Example Use Cases**: 
- Manage internal communications by summarizing lengthy emails and drafting responses based on previous email threads.
- Support agents can provide customers with instant responses adhering to a company’s communication guidelines, tone, and style.
- Reference other GPTs , such as a data analsys GPT, and then ask for a draft/send of the consolidated analysis through email communication.

## Application Information

### Application Key Links

Check out these links from the application before you get started:
- Application Website: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox
- Application API Documentation: https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides

### Application Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you’ve a Google Cloud account and that the Gmail API is enabled:
- Set up a Google Cloud project
- Enable Gmail API from Google API Library
- If application’s  “Publishing Status” is “Testing”, ensure users are added to your application

## ChatGPT Steps

### Custom GPT Instructions 

Once you've created a Custom GPT, copy the text below in the Instructions panel. Have questions? Check out [Getting Started Example](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/getting-started) to see how this step works in more detail.


```python
**Context**
Act as an email assistant designed to enhance user interaction with emails in various ways. This GPT can assist with productivity by summarizing emails/threads, identifying next steps/follow-ups, drafting or sending pre-written responses, and programmatically interacting with third-party tools (e.g., Notion to-dos, Slack channel summaries, data extraction for responses). This GPT has full scope access to the GMAIL OAuth 2.0 API, capable of reading, composing, sending, and permanently deleting emails from Gmail.

**Instructions**
- Always conclude an email by signing off with logged in user's name, unless otherwise stated.
- Verify that the email data is correctly encoded in the required format (e.g., base64 for the message body).
- Email Encoding Process: 1\ Construct the email message in RFC 2822 format. 2\ Base64 encode the email message. 3\Send the encoded message using the API.
- If not specified, sign all emails with the user name.
- API Usage: After answering the user's question, do not call the Google API again until another question is asked.
- All emails created, draft or sent, should be in plain text.
- Ensure that the email format is clean and is formatted as if someone sent the email from their own inbox. Once a draft is created or email sent, display a message to the user confirming that the draft is ready or the email is sent.
- Check that the "to" email address is valid and in the correct format. It should be in the format "recipient@example.com". 
- Only provide summaries of existing emails; do not fabricate email content.
- Professionalism: Behave professionally, providing clear and concise responses.
- Clarification: Ask for clarification when needed to ensure accuracy and completeness in fulfilling user requests.
- Privacy and Security: Respect user privacy and handle all data securely.

## Authentication Instructions

Below are instructions on setting up authentication with this 3rd party application. Have questions? Check out [Getting Started Example](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/getting-started) to see how this step works in more detail.

### Pre-Action Steps

Before you set up authentication in ChatGPT, please take the following steps in the application.


- Go to the Google Cloud Console
- Navigate to API & Services > Credentials

![gptactions_BigQuery_auth.png](../../../images/gptactions_Gmail_enableAPIs.png)

![gptactions_BigQuery_auth.png](../../../images/gptactions_Gmail_gmailApiTile.png)

- Create new OAuth credentials (or use an existing one)

![gptactions_BigQuery_auth.png](../../../images/gptactions_Gmail_apikey.png)

- Locate your OAuth Client ID & Client Secret and store both values securely (see screenshot below)

![gptactions_BigQuery_auth.png](../../../images/gptactions_Gmail_clientidsecret.png)

### In ChatGPT

In ChatGPT, click on "Authentication" and choose **"OAuth"**. Enter in the information below. 

- **Client ID**: use Client ID from steps above 
- **Client Secret**: use Client Secret from steps above
- **Authorization URL**: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
- **Token URL**: https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token 
- **Scope**: https://mail.google.com/
- **Token**: Default (POST)

### Post-Action Steps

Once you've set up authentication in ChatGPT, follow the steps below in the application to finalize the Action. 

- Copy the callback URL from the GPT Action
- In the “Authorized redirect URIs” (see screenshot above), add your callback URL 


### FAQ & Troubleshooting

- *Callback URL Error:* If you get a callback URL error in ChatGPT, pay close attention to the screenshot above. You need to add the callback URL directly into GCP for the action to authenticate correctly
- *Schema calls the wrong project or dataset:* If ChatGPT calls the wrong project or dataset, consider updating your instructions to make it more explicit either (a) which project / dataset should be called or (b) to require the user provide those exact details before it runs the query

*Are there integrations that you’d like us to prioritize? Are there errors in our integrations? File a PR or issue in our github, and we’ll take a look.*
