## ReAct Technique
First introduced in a paper by [Yao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629), ReAct is a reasoning and acting paradigm that guides LLM to respond in a structured manager to complex queries. Reasoning and actions are interleaved and progressive, in the manner of chain of thought, so that LLM progresses from one result to another, using the previous answer.

<img src="https://www.promptingguide.ai/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freact.8e7c93ae.png&w=1920&q=75">

Results suggest that ReAct outperforms other leading methods in language and decision-making tasks, enhancing human understanding and trusting in large language models (LLMs). It is best when combined with chain-of-thought (CoT) steps as individual tasks with results being used for the next step, utilizing both internal knowledge and external information during reasoning.

Let's first use a few-shot examples to indicate how an LLM should progress with its reasoning and acting to solve a complex query, requiring intermideiate results to progress to its final outcome

        answer='The correct answer would be similar to Student Attempts #4 and #5, taking into account both daily ascent rates and acclimatization days when predicting the number of days it would take to reach the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. For example, a common itinerary for climbing Mount Kilimanjaro includes 2-3 days for acclimatization and 4-5 days for summit ascents, making the total time around 6-7 days. However, individual climbing plans may vary depending on factors such as fitness level, experience, and personal preferences.'
