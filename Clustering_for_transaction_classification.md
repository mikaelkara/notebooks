# Clustering for Transaction Classification

This notebook covers use cases where your data is unlabelled but has features that can be used to cluster them into meaningful categories. The challenge with clustering is making the features that make those clusters stand out human-readable, and that is where we'll look to use GPT-3 to generate meaningful cluster descriptions for us. We can then use these to apply labels to a previously unlabelled dataset.

To feed the model we use embeddings created using the approach displayed in the notebook [Multiclass classification for transactions Notebook](Multiclass_classification_for_transactions.ipynb), applied to the full 359 transactions in the dataset to give us a bigger pool for learning

## Setup


```python
# optional env import
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```




    True




```python
# imports
 
from openai import OpenAI
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os
from ast import literal_eval

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "<your OpenAI API key if not set as env var>"))
COMPLETIONS_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

# This path leads to a file with data and precomputed embeddings
embedding_path = "data/library_transactions_with_embeddings_359.csv"

```

## Clustering

We'll reuse the approach from the [Clustering Notebook](Clustering.ipynb), using K-Means to cluster our dataset using the feature embeddings we created previously. We'll then use the Completions endpoint to generate cluster descriptions for us and judge their effectiveness

### Conclusion

We now have five new clusters that we can use to describe our data. Looking at the visualisation some of our clusters have some overlap and we'll need some tuning to get to the right place, but already we can see that GPT-3 has made some effective inferences. In particular, it picked up that items including legal deposits were related to literature archival, which is true but the model was given no clues on. Very cool, and with some tuning we can create a base set of clusters that we can then use with a multiclass classifier to generalise to other transactional datasets we might use.
