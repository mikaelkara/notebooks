# Create a marketing campaign from a product sketch of a Jet Backpack

This notebook contains a code example of using the Gemini API to analyze a a product sketch (in this case, a drawing of a Jet Backpack), create a marketing campaign for it, and output taglines in JSON format.

<table align="left">
  <td>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/Market_a_Jet_Backpack.ipynb"><img src="../images/colab_logo_32px.png" />Run in Google Colab</a>
  </td>
</table>

## Setup


```
!pip install -q "google-generativeai>=0.7.2"
```


```
from google.colab import userdata
import google.generativeai as genai
import PIL.Image
from IPython.display import display, Image, HTML
import ipywidgets as widgets

import json
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
```

To run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a Colab Secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. If you don't already have an API key, or you're not sure how to create a Colab Secret, see the [Authentication](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb) quickstart for an example.


```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
```

## Marketing Campaign
- Product Name
- Description
- Feature List / Descriptions
- H1
- H2



```
model = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name='gemini-1.5-flash')
```

## Analyze Product Sketch

First you will download a sample image to be used:


```
productSketchUrl = "https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/images/jetpack.jpg"
!curl -o jetpack.jpg {productSketchUrl}
```

      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
      0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0100  349k  100  349k    0     0  2141k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 2155k
    

You can view the sample image to understand the prompts you are going to work with:


```
img = PIL.Image.open('jetpack.jpg')
display(Image('jetpack.jpg', width=300))
```


    
![jpeg](output_14_0.jpg)
    


Now define a prompt to analyze the sample image:


```
analyzePrompt = """This image contains a sketch of a potential product along with some notes.
Given the product sketch, describe the product as thoroughly as possible based on what you
see in the image, making sure to note all of the product features.

Return output in json format."""
```

- Set the model to return JSON by setting `response_mime_type="application/json"`.
- Describe the schema for the response using a `TypedDict`.


```
class Response(TypedDict):
  description: str
  features: list[str]
```


```
response = model.generate_content(
    [analyzePrompt, img],
    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(
        response_mime_type="application/json",
        response_schema=Response))
```


```
productInfo = json.loads(response.text)

print(json.dumps(productInfo, indent=4))
```

    {
        "description": "The Jetpack Backpack is a backpack that looks like a normal backpack but has retractable boosters that allow the user to fly. It has a 15-minute battery life and can be charged using a USB-C port. It is lightweight and can fit a 18\" laptop.",
        "features": [
            "retractable boosters",
            "15-min battery life",
            "USB-C charging",
            "lightweight",
            "fits 18\" laptop",
            "steam-powered",
            "green/clean",
            "padded strap support"
        ]
    }
    

> Note: Here the model is just following text instructions for how the output json should be formatted. The API also supports a **strict JSON mode** where you specify a schema, and the API uses "Controlled Generation" (aka "Constrained Decoding") to ensure the model follows the schema, see the [JSON mode quickstart](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/JSON_mode.ipynb) for details.

## Generate marketing ideas

Now using the image you can use Gemini API to generate marketing names ideas:


```
namePrompt = """You are a marketing whiz and writer trying to come up with a name for the
product shown in the image. Come up with ten varied, interesting possible names."""

response = model.generate_content(
    [namePrompt, img],
    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(
        response_mime_type="application/json",
        response_schema=list[str]))

names = json.loads(response.text)
# Create a Dropdown widget to choose a name from the
# returned possible names
dropdown = widgets.Dropdown(
    options=names,
    value=names[0],  # default value
    description='Name:',
    disabled=False,
)
display(dropdown)
```


    Dropdown(description='Name:', options=('Jetpack', 'FlytePack', 'The Booster', 'SkyBackpack', 'The Commute Jet'â€¦


Finally you can work on generating a page for your product campaign:


```
name = dropdown.value
```


```
websiteCopyPrompt = f"""You're a marketing whiz and expert copywriter. You're writing
website copy for a product named {name}. Your first job is to come up with H1

}}]
