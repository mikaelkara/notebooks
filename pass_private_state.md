# How to pass private state between nodes

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#multiple-schemas">
                    Multiple Schemas
                </a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div> 

In some cases, you may want nodes to exchange information that is crucial for intermediate logic but doesn’t need to be part of the main schema of the graph. This private data is not relevant to the overall input/output of the graph and should only be shared between certain nodes.

In this how-to guide, we'll create an example sequential graph consisting of three nodes (node_1, node_2 and node_3), where private data is passed between the first two steps (node_1 and node_2), while the third step (node_3) only has access to the public overall state.

## Setup

First, let's install the required packages


```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph
```

## Define and use the graph


```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from typing_extensions import TypedDict


# The overall state of the graph (this is the public state shared across nodes)
class OverallState(TypedDict):
    a: str


# Output from node_1 contains private data that is not part of the overall state
class Node1Output(TypedDict):
    private_data: str


# The private data is only shared between node_1 and node_2
def node_1(state: OverallState) -> Node1Output:
    output = {"private_data": "set by node_1"}
    print(f"Entered node `node_1`:\n\tInput: {state}.\n\tReturned: {output}")
    return output


# Node 2 input only requests the private data available after node_1
class Node2Input(TypedDict):
    private_data: str


def node_2(state: Node2Input) -> OverallState:
    output = {"a": "set by node_2"}
    print(f"Entered node `node_2`:\n\tInput: {state}.\n\tReturned: {output}")
    return output


# Node 3 only has access to the overall state (no access to private data from node_1)
def node_3(state: OverallState) -> OverallState:
    output = {"a": "set by node_3"}
    print(f"Entered node `node_3`:\n\tInput: {state}.\n\tReturned: {output}")
    return output


# Build the state graph
builder = StateGraph(OverallState)
builder.add_node(node_1)  # node_1 is the first node
builder.add_node(
    node_2
)  # node_2 is the second node and accepts private data from node_1
builder.add_node(node_3)  # node_3 is the third node and does not see the private data
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")  # Start the graph with node_1
builder.add_edge("node_1", "node_2")  # Pass from node_1 to node_2
builder.add_edge(
    "node_2", "node_3"
)  # Pass from node_2 to node_3 (only overall state is shared)
builder.add_edge("node_3", END)  # End the graph after node_3
graph = builder.compile()

# Invoke the graph with the initial state
response = graph.invoke(
    {
        "a": "set at start",
    }
)

print()
print(f"Output of graph invocation: {response}")
```

    Entered node `node_1`:
    	Input: {'a': 'set at start'}.
    	Returned: {'private_data': 'set by node_1'}
    Entered node `node_2`:
    	Input: {'private_data': 'set by node_1'}.
    	Returned: {'a': 'set by node_2'}
    Entered node `node_3`:
    	Input: {'a': 'set by node_2'}.
    	Returned: {'a': 'set by node_3'}
    
    Output of graph invocation: {'a': 'set by node_3'}
