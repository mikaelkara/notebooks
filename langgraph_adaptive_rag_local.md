# Local RAG agent with LLaMA3

We'll combine ideas from paper RAG papers into a RAG agent:

- **Routing:**  Adaptive RAG ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14403)). Route questions to different retrieval approaches
- **Fallback:** Corrective RAG ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15884.pdf)). Fallback to web search if docs are not relevant to query
- **Self-correction:** Self-RAG ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11511)). Fix answers w/ hallucinations or donâ€™t address question

## Local models

### Embedding
 
[GPT4All Embeddings](https://blog.nomic.ai/posts/nomic-embed-text-v1):

```
pip install langchain-nomic
```

### LLM

Use [Ollama](https://x.com/ollama/status/1839007158865899651) and [llama3.2](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-3-2-connect-2024-vision-edge-mobile-devices/):

```
ollama pull llama3.2:3b-instruct-fp16 
```


```python
### LLM
from langchain_ollama import ChatOllama

local_llm = "llama3.2:3b-instruct-fp16"
llm = ChatOllama(model=local_llm, temperature=0)
llm_json_mode = ChatOllama(model=local_llm, temperature=0, format="json")
```

### Search

For search, we use [Tavily](https://tavily.com/), which is a search engine optimized for LLMs and RAG.


```python
import os
import getpass


def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")


_set_env("TAVILY_API_KEY")
os.environ["TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM"] = "true"
```

### Tracing 

Optionally, use [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith) for tracing. 


```python
_set_env("LANGCHAIN_API_KEY")
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_PROJECT"] = "local-llama32-rag"
```

### Vectorstore 


```python

    "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/",
]

# Load documents
docs = [WebBaseLoader(url).load() for url in urls]
docs_list = [item for sublist in docs for item in sublist]

# Split documents
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder(
    chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200

doc_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs_list)

# Add to vectorDB
vectorstore = SKLearnVectorStore.from_documents(
    documents=doc_splits,
    embedding=NomicEmbeddings(model="nomic-embed-text-v1.5", inference_mode="local"),
)

# Create retriever
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(k=3)
```

    USER_AGENT environment variable not set, consider setting it to identify your requests.

    Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique used in natural language processing to generate human-like responses by iteratively asking questions and refining the search space through external search queries, such as Wikipedia APIs. CoT prompting involves decomposing problems into multiple thought steps, generating multiple thoughts per step, and evaluating each state using a classifier or majority vote. The goal is to find an optimal instruction that leads to the desired output, which can be achieved by optimizing prompt parameters directly on the embedding space via gradient descent or searching over a pool of model-generated instruction candidates.

## Web Search Tool


```python
### Search
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults

web_search_tool = TavilySearchResults(k=3)
```

# Graph 

We build the above workflow as a graph using [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/).

### Graph state

The graph `state` schema contains keys that we want to:

* Pass to each node in our graph
* Optionally, modify in each node of our graph 

See conceptual docs [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#state).


```python
import operator
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from typing import List, Annotated


class GraphState(TypedDict):
    """
    Graph state is a dictionary that contains information we want to propagate to, and modify in, each graph node.
    """

    question: str  # User question
    generation: str  # LLM generation
    web_search: str  # Binary decision to run web search
    max_retries: int  # Max number of retries for answer generation
    answers: int  # Number of answers generated
    loop_step: Annotated[int, operator.add]
    documents: List[str]  # List of retrieved documents
```

Each node in our graph is simply a function that:

(1) Take `state` as an input

(2) Modifies `state` 

(3) Write the modified `state` to the state schema (dict)

See conceptual docs [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#nodes).

Each edge routes between nodes in the graph.

See conceptual docs [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#edges).
