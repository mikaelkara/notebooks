## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the embeddings from the Gemini API to detect potential outliers in your dataset. You will visualize a subset of the 20 Newsgroup dataset using [t-SNE](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) and detect outliers outside a particular radius of the central point of each categorical cluster.



```
!pip install -U -q "google-generativeai>=0.7.2"
```


```
import re
import tqdm
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

import google.generativeai as genai

# Used to securely store your API key
from google.colab import userdata

from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
```

To run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a Colab Secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. If you don't already have an API key, or you're not sure how to create a Colab Secret, see the [Authentication](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb) quickstart for an example.


```
API_KEY=userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
genai.configure(api_key=API_KEY)
```

## Prepare dataset

The [20 Newsgroups Text Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html){:.external} contains 18,000 newsgroups posts on 20 topics divided into training and test sets. The split between the training and test datasets are based on messages posted before and after a specific date. This tutorial uses the training subset.


```
newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='train')

# View list of class names for dataset
newsgroups_train.target_names
```




    ['alt.atheism',
     'comp.graphics',
     'comp.os.ms-windows.misc',

Here is the first example in the training set.


```
idx = newsgroups_train.data[0].index('Lines')
print(newsgroups_train.data[0][idx:])
```

    Lines: 15
    
     I was wondering if anyone out there could enlighten me on this car I saw
    the other day. It was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/
    early 70s. It was called a Bricklin. The doors were really small. In addition,
    the front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is 
    all I know. If anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years
    of production, where this car is made, history, or whatever info you
    have on this funky looking car, please e-mail.
    
    Thanks,
    - IL

Next, sample some of the data by taking 150 data points in the training dataset and choosing a few categories. This tutorial uses the science categories.


```
# Take a sample of each label category from df_train
SAMPLE_SIZE = 150
df_train = (df_train.groupby('Label', as_index = False)
                    .apply(lambda x: x.sample(SAMPLE_SIZE))
                    .reset_index(drop=True))

# Choose categories about science
df_train = df_train[df_train['Class Name'].str.contains('sci')]

## Create the embeddings

In this section, you will see how to generate embeddings for the different texts in the dataframe using the embeddings from the Gemini API.

### API changes to Embeddings with model embedding-001

For the new embeddings model, embedding-001, there is a new task type parameter and the optional title (only valid with task_type=`RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`).

These new parameters apply only to the newest embeddings models.The task types are:

Task Type | Description
---       | ---
RETRIEVAL_QUERY	| Specifies the given text is a query in a search/retrieval setting.
RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT | Specifies the given text is a document in a search/retrieval setting.
SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY	| Specifies the given text will be used for Semantic Textual Similarity (STS).
CLASSIFICATION	| Specifies that the embeddings will be used for classification.
CLUSTERING	| Specifies that the embeddings will be used for clustering.


```
from tqdm.auto import tqdm
tqdm.pandas()

from google.api_core import retry

def make_embed_text_fn(model):

  @retry.Retry(timeout=300.0)
  def embed_fn(text: str) -> list[float]:
    # Set the task_type to CLUSTERING.
    embedding = genai.embed_content(model=model,
                                    content=text,
                                    task_type="clustering")['embedding']
    return np.array(embedding)

  return embed_fn

def create_embeddings(df):
  model = 'models/embedding-001'
  df['Embeddings'] = df['Text'].progress_apply(make_embed_text_fn(model))
  return df

df_train = create_embeddings(df_train)
df_train.drop('index', axis=1, inplace=True)
```


      0%|          | 0/600 [00:00<?, ?it/s]


## Dimensionality reduction

The dimension of the document embedding vector is 768. In order to visualize how the embedded documents are grouped together, you will need to apply dimensionality reduction as you can only visualize the embeddings in 2D or 3D space. Contextually similar documents should be closer together in space as opposed to documents that are not as similar.


```
len(df_train['Embeddings'][0])
```




    768




```
# Convert df_train['Embeddings'] Pandas series to a np.array of float32
X = np.array(df_train['Embeddings'].to_list(), dtype=np.float32)
X.shape
```




    (600, 768)



You will apply the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) approach to perform dimensionality reduction. This technique reduces the number of dimensions, while preserving clusters (points that are close together stay close together). For the original data, the model tries to construct a distribution over which other data points are "neighbors" (e.g., they share a similar meaning). It then optimizes an objective function to keep a similar distribution in the visualization.


```
tsne = TSNE(random_state=0, max_iter=1000)
tsne_results = tsne.fit_transform(X)
```


```
df_tsne = pd.DataFrame(tsne_results, columns=['TSNE1', 'TSNE2'])
df_tsne['Class Name'] = df_train['Class Name'] # Add labels column from df_train to df_tsne
df_tsne
```

## Outlier detection

To determine which points are anomalous, you will determine which points are inliers and outliers. Start by finding the centroid, or location that represents the center of the cluster, and use the distance to determine the points that are outliers.

Start by getting the centroid of each category.


```
def get_centroids(df_tsne):
  # Get the centroid of each cluster
  centroids = df_tsne.groupby('Class Name').mean()
  return centroids

centroids = get_centroids(df_tsne)

Choose a radius. Anything beyond this bound from the centroid of that category is considered an outlier.


```
def calculate_euclidean_distance(p1, p2):
  return np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(p1 - p2)))

def detect_outlier(df, emb_centroids, radius):
  for idx, row in df.iterrows():
    class_name = row['Class Name'] # Get class name of row
    # Compare centroid distances
    dist = calculate_euclidean_distance(row['Embeddings'],
                                        emb_centroids[class_name])
    df.at[idx, 'Outlier'] = dist > radius

  return len(df[df['Outlier'] == True])
```


```
range_ = np.arange(0.3, 0.75, 0.02).round(decimals=2).tolist()
num_outliers = []
for i in range_:
  num_outliers.append(detect_outlier(df_train, emb_c, i))
```


```
# Plot range_ and num_outliers
fig = plt.figure(figsize = (14, 8))
plt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 12})
plt.bar(list(map(str, range_)), num_outliers)
plt.title("Number of outliers vs. distance of points from centroid")
plt.xlabel("Distance")
plt.ylabel("Number of outliers")
for i in range(len(range_)):
  plt.text(i, num_outliers[i], num_outliers[i], ha = 'center')

plt.show()
```

Depending on how sensitive you want your anomaly detector to be, you can choose which radius you would like to use. For now, 0.62 is used, but you can change this value.


```
# View the points that are outliers
RADIUS = 0.62
detect_outlier(df_train, emb_c, RADIUS)
df_outliers = df_train[df_train['Outlier'] == True]
df_outliers.head()
```

    <8.1> What are some known anonymous remailing and posting sites?
    
      Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites
      is anon.penet.fi operated by  for several months, who
      has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment. 
      Including anonymized mail, Usenet posting, and return addresses 
      .  Send mail to  for information.
     
      Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk
      remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu :
      pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z  and anonmail.arj .

        address for information.
    
      Notes
      =====
      
      - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often
        running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues
        are wholly unresolved.
      
      - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP
        software . 
    
      - Encryption aspects 
        vary between sites.
    
      - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are
        mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.
    
    _____
    <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?
    
      
      Users
      -----
    
      - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the
        seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.
      - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.
      - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on
        Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.
      - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.
        Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases
        network traffic.
      - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this
        is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'
        hierarchy is preferred.
      - Give as much information as possible in the posting  Remember that content is the only means for
        readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any
        inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even
        future ones under the same handle.
      - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your
        identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by
        sending anonymized mail to yourself.
      - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them. 
        Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.
      - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.
      - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.
        Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.
      - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large
        amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating
        his hardware, all for your convenience.
    
      Operators
      ---------
    
      - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an
        introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and
        consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and
        monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and
        security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or
        lassaiz-faire?
      - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate
        potentially intense moral quandaries and dil

    As a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer
    the circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentary
    opening and closing of the path.
    
    The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high
    impedance audio circuits a resistive "T" is constructed close to characteristic
    impedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs  transfers
    the audio.
    
    In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are
    shorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic
    impedance.
    
    Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used
    to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.
    
    Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to "Make before
    break and Vica Versa" but I haven't seen any of these for years.
    
    Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.
    
    A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive "optical isolator".. It consists
    of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is
    off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers
    passing the audio.  Once again this device in a "T" switches the audio.  Varying
    the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and
    you have a mixer!
    
    Lots of luck!

    The proper spelling is Kirlian. It was an effect discoverd by
    S. Kirlian, a soviet film developer in 1939.
    
    As I recall, the coronas visible are ascribed to static discharges
    and chemical reactions between the organic material and the silver
    halides in the films.

    4/06/93:  GIBBONS OUTLINES SPACE STATION REDESIGN GUIDANCE
    
    NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.
    April 6, 1993
    
    RELEASE:  93-64
    
            Dr.  John H.  Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology
    Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the
    Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance
    to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space
    station.
    
            A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a
    high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each
    option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal
    year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,
    operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research
    operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program
    reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.
    
            Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA
    budget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result,
    station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting
    reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station
    option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA
    budget over the next 5 years.
    
            Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of
    the advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon
    administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also
    received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the
    Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory
    committee to consider.
    
            Gibbons also announced that the United States and its
    international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have
    decided, after consultation, to give "full consideration" to use of
    Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.
    
            To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the
    redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign
    team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR
    and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.
    The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of
    the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The
    overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing
    station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.
    Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving
    that goal.
    
            Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is committed to the
    redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the
    science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program
    represents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well
    managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should
    be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation."
    
            NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian
    participation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science
    Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald
    Sagdeev.

## Next steps

You've now created an anomaly detector using embeddings! Try using your own textual data to visualize them as embeddings, and choose some bound such that you can detect outliers. You can perform dimensionality reduction in order to complete the visualization step. Note that t-SNE is good at clustering inputs, but can take a longer time to converge or might get stuck at local minima. If you run into this issue, another technique you could consider are [principal components analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis).
