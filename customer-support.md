# Build a Customer Support Bot

Customer support bots can free up teams' time by handling routine issues, but it can be hard to build a bot that reliably handles diverse tasks in a way that doesn't leave the user pulling their hair out.

In this tutorial, you will build a customer support bot for an airline to help users research and make travel arrangements. You'll learn to use LangGraph's interrupts and checkpointers and more complex state to organize your assistant's tools and manage a user's flight bookings, hotel reservations, car rentals, and excursions. It assumes you are familiar with the concepts presented in the [LangGraph introductory tutorial](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/).

By the end, you'll have built a working bot and gained an understanding of  LangGraph's key concepts and architectures. You'll be able to apply these design patterns to your other AI projects.

Your final chat bot will look something like the following diagram:

Let's start!

## Prerequisites

First, set up your environment. We'll install this tutorial's prerequisites, download the test DB, and define the tools we will reuse in each section.

We'll be using Claude as our LLM and define a number of custom tools. While most of our tools will connect to a local sqlite database (and require no additional dependencies), we will also provide a general web search to the agent using Tavily.


```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-community langchain-anthropic tavily-python pandas openai
```


```python
import getpass
import os


def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")


_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
_set_env("TAVILY_API_KEY")
```

#### Populate the database

Run the next script to fetch a `sqlite` DB we've prepared for this tutorial and update it to look like it's current. The details are unimportant.


```python
import os
import shutil
import sqlite3

import pandas as pd
import requests

db_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/benchmarks-artifacts/travel-db/travel2.sqlite"
local_file = "travel2.sqlite"
# The backup lets us restart for each tutorial section
backup_file = "travel2.backup.sqlite"
overwrite = False
if overwrite or not os.path.exists(local_file):
    response = requests.get(db_url)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Ensure the request was successful
    with open(local_file, "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    # Backup - we will use this to "reset" our DB in each section
    shutil.copy(local_file, backup_file)


# Convert the flights to present time for our tutorial
def update_dates(file):
    shutil.copy(backup_file, file)
    conn = sqlite3.connect(file)
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    tables = pd.read_sql(
        "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';", conn
    ).name.tolist()
    tdf = {}
    for t in tables:
        tdf[t] = pd.read_sql(f"SELECT * from {t}", conn)

    example_time = pd.to_datetime(
        tdf["flights"]["actual_departure"].replace("\\N", pd.NaT)
    ).max()
    current_time = pd.to_datetime("now").tz_localize(example_time.tz)
    time_diff = current_time - example_time

    tdf["bookings"]["book_date"] = (
        pd.to_datetime(tdf["bookings"]["book_date"].replace("\\N", pd.NaT), utc=True)
        + time_diff
    )

    datetime_columns = [
        "scheduled_departure",
        "scheduled_arrival",
        "actual_departure",
        "actual_arrival",
    ]
    for column in datetime_columns:
        tdf["flights"][column] = (
            pd.to_datetime(tdf["flights"][column].replace("\\N", pd.NaT)) + time_diff
        )

    for table_name, df in tdf.items():
        df.to_sql(table_name, conn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
    del df
    del tdf
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

    return file


db = update_dates(local_file)
```

## Tools

Next, define our assistant's tools to search the airline's policy manual and search and manage reservations for flights, hotels, car rentals, and excursions. We will reuse these tools throughout the tutorial. The exact implementations
aren't important, so feel free to run the code below and jump to [Part 1](#part-1-zero-shot).

#### Lookup Company Policies

The assistant retrieve policy information to answer user questions. Note that _enforcement_ of these policies still must be done within the tools/APIs themselves, since the LLM can always ignore this.


```python
import re

import numpy as np
import openai
from langchain_core.tools import tool

response = requests.get(
    "https://storage.googleapis.com/benchmarks-artifacts/travel-db/swiss_faq.md"
)
response.raise_for_status()
faq_text = response.text

docs = [{"page_content": txt} for txt in re.split(r"(?=\n##)", faq_text)]


class VectorStoreRetriever:
    def __init__(self, docs: list, vectors: list, oai_client):
        self._arr = np.array(vectors)
        self._docs = docs
        self._client = oai_client

    @classmethod
    def from_docs(cls, docs, oai_client):
        embeddings = oai_client.embeddings.create(
            model="text-embedding-3-small", input=[doc["page_content"] for doc in docs]
        )
        vectors = [emb.embedding for emb in embeddings.data]
        return cls(docs, vectors, oai_client)

    def query(self, query: str, k: int = 5) -> list[dict]:
        embed = self._client.embeddings.create(
            model="text-embedding-3-small", input=[query]
        )
        # "@" is just a matrix multiplication in python
        scores = np.array(embed.data[0].embedding) @ self._arr.T
        top_k_idx = np.argpartition(scores, -k)[-k:]
        top_k_idx_sorted = top_k_idx[np.argsort(-scores[top_k_idx])]
        return [
            {**self._docs[idx], "similarity": scores[idx]} for idx in top_k_idx_sorted
        ]


retriever = VectorStoreRetriever.from_docs(docs, openai.Client())


@tool
def lookup_policy(query: str) -> str:
    """Consult the company policies to check whether certain options are permitted.
    Use this before making any flight changes performing other 'write' events."""
    docs = retriever.query(query, k=2)
    return "\n\n".join([doc["page_content"] for doc in docs])
```

#### Flights

Define the (`fetch_user_flight_information`) tool to let the agent see the current user's flight information.  Then define tools to search for flights and manage the passenger's bookings stored in the SQL database.

We the can [access the RunnableConfig](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/tool_configure/#inferring-by-parameter-type) for a given run to check the `passenger_id` of the user accessing this application. The LLM never has to provide these explicitly, they are provided for a given invocation of the graph so that each user cannot access other passengers' booking information.

<div class="admonition warning">
    <p class="admonition-title">Compatibility</p>
    <p>
        This tutorial expects `langchain-core>=0.2.16` to use the injected RunnableConfig. Prior to that, you'd use `ensure_config` to collect the config from context.

#### Car Rental Tools

Once a user books a flight, they likely will want to organize transportation. Define some "car rental" tools to let the user search for and reserve a car at their destination.


```python

#### Excursions

Finally, define some tools to let the user search for things to do (and make reservations) once they arrive.


```python
@tool

    location: Optional[str] = None,
    name: Optional[str] = None,
    keywords: Optional[str] = None,

#### Utilities

Define helper functions to pretty print the messages in the graph while we debug it and to give our tool node error handling (by adding the error to the chat history).


```python
from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda

from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode


def handle_tool_error(state) -> dict:
    error = state.get("error")
    tool_calls = state["messages"][-1].tool_calls
    return {
        "messages": [
            ToolMessage(
                content=f"Error: {repr(error)}\n please fix your mistakes.",
                tool_call_id=tc["id"],
            )
            for tc in tool_calls
        ]
    }


def create_tool_node_with_fallback(tools: list) -> dict:
    return ToolNode(tools).with_fallbacks(
        [RunnableLambda(handle_tool_error)], exception_key="error"
    )


def _print_event(event: dict, _printed: set, max_length=1500):
    current_state = event.get("dialog_state")
    if current_state:
        print("Currently in: ", current_state[-1])
    message = event.get("messages")
    if message:
        if isinstance(message, list):
            message = message[-1]
        if message.id not in _printed:
            msg_repr = message.pretty_repr(html=True)
            if len(msg_repr) > max_length:
                msg_repr = msg_repr[:max_length] + " ... (truncated)"
            print(msg_repr)
            _printed.add(message.id)
```

## Part 1: Zero-shot Agent

When building, it's best to start with the simplest working implementation and use an [evaluation tool like LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation) to measure its efficacy. All else equal, prefer simple, scalable solutions to complicated ones. In this case, the single-graph approach has limitations. The bot may take undesired actions without user confirmation, struggle with complex queries, and lack focus in its responses. We'll address these issues later. 

In this section, we will define a simple Zero-shot agent as the assistant, give the agent **all** of our tools, and prompt it to use them judiciously to assist the user.

The simple 2-node graph will look like the following:

<img src="./img/part-1-diagram.png" src="../img/part-1-diagram.png">

Start by defining the state.

#### State

Define our `StateGraph`'s state as a typed dictionary containing an append-only list of messages. These messages form the chat history, which is all the state our simple assistant needs.


```python
from typing import Annotated

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph.message import AnyMessage, add_messages


class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]
```

#### Agent

Next, define the assistant function. This function takes the graph state, formats it into a prompt, and then calls an LLM for it to predict the best response.


```python
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import Runnable, RunnableConfig


class Assistant:
    def __init__(self, runnable: Runnable):
        self.runnable = runnable

    def __call__(self, state: State, config: RunnableConfig):
        while True:
            configuration = config.get("configurable", {})
            passenger_id = configuration.get("passenger_id", None)
            state = {**state, "user_info": passenger_id}
            result = self.runnable.invoke(state)
            # If the LLM happens to return an empty response, we will re-prompt it
            # for an actual response.
            if not result.tool_calls and (
                not result.content
                or isinstance(result.content, list)
                and not result.content[0].get("text")
            ):
                messages = state["messages"] + [("user", "Respond with a real output.")]
                state = {**state, "messages": messages}
            else:
                break
        return {"messages": result}


# Haiku is faster and cheaper, but less accurate
# llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229", temperature=1)
# You could swap LLMs, though you will likely want to update the prompts when
# doing so!
# from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4-turbo-preview")

primary_assistant_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            "You are a helpful customer support assistant for Swiss Airlines. "
            " Use the provided tools to search for flights, company policies, and other information to assist the user's queries. "
            " When searching, be persistent. Expand your query bounds if the first search returns no results. "
            " If a search comes up empty, expand your search before giving up."
            "\n\nCurrent user:\n<User>\n{user_info}\n</User>"
            "\nCurrent time: {time}.",
        ),
        ("placeholder", "{messages}"),
    ]
).partial(time=datetime.now)

part_1_tools = [
    TavilySearchResults(max_results=1),
    fetch_user_flight_information,
    search_flights,
    lookup_policy,
    update_ticket_to_new_flight,
    cancel_ticket,
    search_car_rentals,
    book_car_rental,
    update_car_rental,
    cancel_car_rental,
    search_hotels,
    book_hotel,
    update_hotel,
    cancel_hotel,
    search_trip_recommendations,
    book_excursion,
    update_excursion,
    cancel_excursion,
]
part_1_assistant_runnable = primary_assistant_prompt | llm.bind_tools(part_1_tools)
```

#### Define Graph

Now, create the graph. The graph is the final assistant for this section.


```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph, START
from langgraph.prebuilt import tools_condition

builder = StateGraph(State)


# Define nodes: these do the work
builder.add_node("assistant", Assistant(part_1_assistant_runnable))
builder.add_node("tools", create_tool_node_with_fallback(part_1_tools))
# Define edges: these determine how the control flow moves
builder.add_edge(START, "assistant")
builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "assistant",
    tools_condition,
)
builder.add_edge("tools", "assistant")

# The checkpointer lets the graph persist its state
# this is a complete memory for the entire graph.
memory = MemorySaver()
part_1_graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)
```


```python
from IPython.display import Image, display

try:
    display(Image(part_1_graph.get_graph(xray=True).draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass
```


    
![jpeg](output_24_0.jpg)
    


#### Example Conversation

Now it's time to try out our mighty chatbot! Let's run it over the following list of dialog turns. If it hits a "RecursionLimit", that means the agent wasn't able to get an answer in the allocated number of steps. That's OK! We have more tricks up our sleeve in later sections of this tutorial.


```python
import shutil
import uuid

# Let's create an example conversation a user might have with the assistant
tutorial_questions = [
    "Hi there, what time is my flight?",
    "Am i allowed to update my flight to something sooner? I want to leave later today.",
    "Update my flight to sometime next week then",
    "The next available option is great",
    "what about lodging and transportation?",
    "Yeah i think i'd like an affordable hotel for my week-long stay (7 days). And I'll want to rent a car.",
    "OK could you place a reservation for your recommended hotel? It sounds nice.",
    "yes go ahead and book anything that's moderate expense and has availability.",
    "Now for a car, what are my options?",
    "Awesome let's just get the cheapest option. Go ahead and book for 7 days",
    "Cool so now what recommendations do you have on excursions?",
    "Are they available while I'm there?",
    "interesting - i like the museums, what options are there? ",
    "OK great pick one and book it for my second day there.",
]

# Update with the backup file so we can restart from the original place in each section
db = update_dates(db)
thread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

config = {
    "configurable": {
        # The passenger_id is used in our flight tools to

        # Checkpoints are accessed by thread_id
        "thread_id": thread_id,
    }
}


_printed = set()

    ## Booking and Cancellation
    
    1. How can I change my booking?
    	* The ticket number must start with 724 (SWISS ticket no./plate).
    	* The ticket was not paid for by barter or voucher (there are exceptions to voucher payments; if the ticket was paid for in full by voucher, then it may be possible to rebook online under certain circumstances. If it is not possible to rebook online because of the payment method, then you will be informed accordingly during the rebooking process).
    	* There must be an active flight booking for your ticket. It is not possible to rebook open tickets or tickets without the corresponding flight segments online at the moment.
    	* It is currently only possible to rebook outbound (one-way) tickets or return tickets with single flight routes (point-to-point).
    2. Which tickets/bookings cannot be rebooked online currently?
    	* Bookings containing flight segments with other airlines
    	* Bookings containing reservations, where a ticket has not yet been issued
    	* Bookings with several valid tickets for the same person and route
    	* Tickets with a status other than O (open) (A)
    	* Bookings with segments with a status other than OK (e.g. containing flight segments with the status Waitlist) (HK|RR)
    	* Tickets that do not display the tariff calculation (IT tickets)

    Based on the policy information, it looks like you are generally allowed to change your flight on the same day for an earlier option, provided your ticket number starts with 724 and some other conditions are met. However, to check if your specific ticket can be updated today, I will need to look up your ticket number or booking reference.
    
    Could you please provide your ticket number or booking reference? Then I can check your flight details and whether you are eligible to change to an earlier flight today per the policy.

    I'm really struggling to find any recommended activities, tours or excursions to book for your stay in the Basel area. It seems the database may be lacking robust options for that region. 
    
    Instead, here are a few potential ideas I could recommend based on some quick research:
    
    - Take a day trip to Lucerne and go see the iconic Chapel Bridge and Lion Monument
    - Visit the Swiss Vapeur Parc, an amusement park focused on trains and transportation
    - Go for a hike up Gempenplateau for scenic views overlooking Basel
    - Take a food tour to sample the local Swiss cuisine like rÃ¶sti and fondue
    - Do a wine tasting day trip out to the vineyards near Alsace, France
    
    Let me know if any of those appeal to you or if you'd like me to find some other moderate activity recommendations for your Basel stay. I can also hold off on booking excursions for now if you prefer to play that portion by ear once there. Just let me know your preference!

    I'm really struggling to find bookable tours or excursions through this system for the Basel/Switzerland area. However, based on some additional research, here are some top recommendations I can provide:
    
    - Take a day trip to Lucerne and go see the iconic Chapel Bridge, Lion Monument, and do a lake cruise
    - Visit the Rhine Falls near Schaffhausen - one of the largest waterfalls in Europe
    - Take a guided walking tour through Basel's old town to see the red sandstone buildings and historical sites
    - Do a day trip into the Swiss Alps, potentially taking a cogwheel train up into the mountains
    - Tour the medieval ChÃ¢teau de Bottmingen just outside of Basel
    - Take a day trip across the border to explore the Alsace wine region of France
    - Visit the Fondation Beyeler museum that houses an impressive modern art collection
    
    Let me know if you'd like me to book any specific tours/excursions from those options, or if you prefer to just have the rental car flexibility to explore Basel and surroundings at your own pace. I'm happy to make excursion bookings or you can play that portion by ear once there. Just let me know what you'd prefer!

    Unfortunately it does not look like my searches are returning any bookable tours or excursions in the Basel area for those date ranges. The database seems to be lacking comprehensive options.
    
    As an alternative, let me suggest just keeping your schedule flexible during your stay. With your rental car, you can easily do self-guided day trips to places like:
    
    - Lucerne (1.5 hour drive)
    - Bern (1 hour drive) 
    - Zurich (1 hour drive)
    - Rhine Falls (45 min drive)
    - Alsace, France (1 hour drive)
    
    And in Basel itself, you can explore at your own pace hitting top sights like:
    
    - Basel Munster cathedral 
    - Old Town
    - Basel Paper Mill Museum
    - Rhine river promenades
    
    There are also several highly-rated free walking tour companies that operate daily in Basel you could join.
    
    Rather than pre-booking rigid excursions, having the rental car will give you maximum flexibility to pick and choose what you want to do day-to-day based on your interests and the weather.
    
    Let me know if you'd still like me to continue searching for pre-bookable tours, or if you're okay winging it and using the rental car to explore Basel and do day trips during your week there.

    Unfortunately I'm still not getting any hits on pre-bookable museum tours or exhibits for the Switzerland/Basel area during your dates. However, from my research, here are some of the top museums I would recommend checking out:
    
    In Basel:
    - Kunstmuseum Basel - This is one of the largest and best art museums in Switzerland with excellent collections of paintings, sculptures, and drawings.
    - Fondation Beyeler - Fantastic modern/contemporary art museum with works by Monet, Warhol, Bacon and more. A bit outside the city center.
    - Basel Paper Mill Museum - Unique museum tracing the history of paper and paper-making.
    - Spielzeug Welten Museum - Fun toy and doll museum for kids and adults alike.
    
    Day Trips: 
    - Albertina Museum (Zurich) - Impressive collections of modern art and photography
    - Sammlung Rosengart (Lucerne) - Housing works by Picasso, CÃ©zanne, Klee and more
    - Olympic Museum (Lausanne) 
    
    Since I couldn't find any pre-booked options, I'd recommend just planning to visit whichever museums pique your interest most once you're in Basel, using your rental car to get around. Most are open daily with ticket purchases available on-site. Let me know if you need any other museum recommendations!
    ================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================
    
    OK great pick one and book it for my second day there.
    ==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
    
    Sure, let's book an museum visit for your second day in Basel, which will be Wednesday, May 9th.
    
    Based on the excellent museum options you have in Basel itself, I'd recommend visiting the acclaimed Kunstmuseum Basel, one of the largest and most impressive art museums in Switzerland.
    
    While I couldn't find a way to pre-book tickets or tours through this system, the Kunstmuseum is open daily, and we can plan for you to purchase tickets directly there on May 9th.
    
    Here are some highlights of the Kunstmuseum Basel that make it a great option:
    
    - It houses the largest and most significant public art collection in the entire country
    - The collection spans from the 15th century up through contemporary art
    - Notable works by Holbein, Witz, Cranach, BÃ¶cklin, CÃ©zanne, Gauguin, Monet, Picasso and more
    - The main building was designed by Christ & Gantenbein and has received architectural awards
    - They have excellent audio guide tours available in multiple languages
    - The museum is conveniently located in the city center, about a 10 minute walk from your hotel
    
    My recommendation would be to plan to arrive at the Kunstmuseum Basel around 10am on Wednesday, May 9th after breakfast. This will allow you to purchase tickets and take your time exploring their impeccable collections and audio tours.
    
    Let me know if you'd like to book the Kunstmuseum for the morning of May 9th, or if you had another museum  ... (truncated)
    

#### Part 1 Review

Our simple assistant is not bad! It was able to respond reasonably well for all the questions, quickly respond in-context, and successfully execute all our tasks. You can (check out an example LangSmith trace)[https://smith.langchain.com/public/f9e77b80-80ec-4837-98a8-254415cb49a1/r/26146720-d3f9-44b6-9bb9-9158cde61f9d] to get a better sense of how the LLM is prompted throughout the interactions above.

If this were a simple Q&A bot, we'd probably be happy with the results above. Since our customer support bot is taking actions on behalf of the user, some of its behavior above is a bit concerning:

1. The assistant booked a car when we were focusing on lodging, then had to cancel and rebook later on: oops! The user should have final say before booking to avoid unwanted feeds.
2. The assistant struggled to search for recommendations. We could improve this by adding more verbose instructions and examples using the tool, but doing this for every tool can lead to a large prompt and overwhelmed agent.
3. The assistant had to do an explicit search just to get the user's relevant information. We can save a lot of time by fetching the user's relevant travel details immediately so the assistant can directly respond.

In the next section, we will address the first two of these issues.

## Part 2: Add Confirmation

When an assistant takes actions on behalf of the user, the user should (almost) always have the final say on whether to follow through with the actions. Otherwise, any small mistake the assistant makes (or any prompt injection it succombs to) can cause real damage to the user.

In this section, we will use `interrupt_before` to pause the graph and return control to the user **before** executing any of the tools.

Your graph will look something like the following:

<img src="./img/part-2-diagram.png" src="../img/part-2-diagram.png">

As before, start by defining the state:

#### State & Assistant

Our graph state and LLM calling is nearly identical to Part 1 except Exception:

- We've added a `user_info` field that will be eagerly populated by our graph
- We can use the state directly in the `Assistant` object rather than using the configurable params


```python
from typing import Annotated

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import Runnable, RunnableConfig
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph.message import AnyMessage, add_messages


class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]
    user_info: str


class Assistant:
    def __init__(self, runnable: Runnable):
        self.runnable = runnable

    def __call__(self, state: State, config: RunnableConfig):
        while True:
            result = self.runnable.invoke(state)
            # If the LLM happens to return an empty response, we will re-prompt it
            # for an actual response.
            if not result.tool_calls and (
                not result.content
                or isinstance(result.content, list)
                and not result.content[0].get("text")
            ):
                messages = state["messages"] + [("user", "Respond with a real output.")]
                state = {**state, "messages": messages}
            else:
                break
        return {"messages": result}


# Haiku is faster and cheaper, but less accurate
# llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229", temperature=1)
# You could also use OpenAI or another model, though you will likely have

            " When searching, be persistent. Expand your query bounds if the first search returns no results. "
            " If a search comes up empty, expand your search before giving up."
            "\n\nCurrent user:\n<User>\n{user_info}\n</User>"
            "\nCurrent time: {time}.",
        ),
        ("placeholder", "{messages}"),
    ]

    update_excursion,
    cancel_excursion,
]
part_2_assistant_runnable = assistant_prompt | llm.bind_tools(part_2_tools)
```

#### Define Graph

Now, create the graph. Make 2 changes from part 1 to address our previous concerns.

1. Add an interrupt before using a tool
2. Explicitly populate the user state within the first node so the assistant doesn't have to use a tool just to learn about the user.


```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.prebuilt import tools_condition

builder = StateGraph(State)


def user_info(state: State):
    return {"user_info": fetch_user_flight_information.invoke({})}


# NEW: The fetch_user_info node runs first, meaning our assistant can see the user's flight information without
# having to take an action
builder.add_node("fetch_user_info", user_info)
builder.add_edge(START, "fetch_user_info")
builder.add_node("assistant", Assistant(part_2_assistant_runnable))
builder.add_node("tools", create_tool_node_with_fallback(part_2_tools))
builder.add_edge("fetch_user_info", "assistant")
builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "assistant",
    tools_condition,
)
builder.add_edge("tools", "assistant")

memory = MemorySaver()
part_2_graph = builder.compile(
    checkpointer=memory,
    # NEW: The graph will always halt before executing the "tools" node.
    # The user can approve or reject (or even alter the request) before
    # the assistant continues
    interrupt_before=["tools"],
)
```


```python
from IPython.display import Image, display

try:
    display(Image(part_2_graph.get_graph(xray=True).draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass
```

#### Example Conversation

Now it's time to try out our newly revised chatbot! Let's run it over the following list of dialog turns.


```python
import shutil
import uuid

# Update with the backup file so we can restart from the original place in each section
db = update_dates(db)
thread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

        "passenger_id": "3442 587242",
        # Checkpoints are accessed by thread_id
        "thread_id": thread_id,
    }
}


_printed = set()
# We can reuse the tutorial questions from part 1 to see how it does.

#### Part 2 Review

Now our assistant was able to save a step to respond with our flight details. We also completely controlled which actions were performed. This all worked using LangGraph's `interrupts` and `checkpointers`. The interrupt pauses graph execution, its state safely persisted using your configured checkpointer. The user can then start it up at any time by running it with the right config.

See an [example LangSmith trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/b3c71814-c366-476d-be6a-f6f3056caaec/r) to get a better sense of how the graph is running. Note [from this trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/a077f4be-6baa-4e97-89f7-0dabc65c0fd0/r) that you typically **resume** a flow by invoking the graph with `(None, config)`. The state is loaded from the checkpoint as if it never was interrupted.

This graph worked pretty well! We *didn't really* need to be involved in *EVERY* assistant action, though...

In the next section, we will reorganize our graph so that we can interrupt only on the "sensitive" actions that actually write to the database.

## Part 3: Conditional Interrupt

In this section, we'll refine our interrupt strategy by categorizing tools as safe (read-only) or sensitive (data-modifying). We'll apply interrupts to the sensitive tools only, allowing the bot to handle simple queries autonomously.

This balances user control and conversational flow, but as we add more tools, our single graph may grow too complex for this "flat" structure. We'll address that in the next section. 

Your graph for Part 3 will look something like the following diagram.

<img src="./img/part-3-diagram.png" src="../img/part-3-diagram.png">

#### State

As always, start by defining the graph state. Our state and LLM calling **are identical to** part 2. 



```python
from typing import Annotated

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import Runnable, RunnableConfig
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph.message import AnyMessage, add_messages


class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]
    user_info: str


class Assistant:
    def __init__(self, runnable: Runnable):
        self.runnable = runnable

    def __call__(self, state: State, config: RunnableConfig):
        while True:
            result = self.runnable.invoke(state)
            # If the LLM happens to return an empty response, we will re-prompt it
            # for an actual response.
            if not result.tool_calls and (
                not result.content
                or isinstance(result.content, list)
                and not result.content[0].get("text")
            ):
                messages = state["messages"] + [("user", "Respond with a real output.")]
                state = {**state, "messages": messages}
            else:
                break
        return {"messages": result}


# Haiku is faster and cheaper, but less accurate

# You can update the LLMs, though you may need to update the prompts
# from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4-turbo-preview")

assistant_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            "You are a helpful customer support assistant for Swiss Airlines. "
            " Use the provided tools to search for flights, company policies, and other information to assist the user's queries. "
            " When searching, be persistent. Expand your query bounds if the first search returns no results. "
            " If a search comes up empty, expand your search before giving up."
            "\n\nCurrent user:\n<User>\n{user_info}\n</User>"
            "\nCurrent time: {time}.",
        ),
        ("placeholder", "{messages}"),
    ]
).partial(time=datetime.now)


# "Read"-only tools (such as retrievers) don't need a user confirmation to use

    TavilySearchResults(max_results=1),

    update_excursion,
    cancel_excursion,
]
sensitive_tool_names = {t.name for t in part_3_sensitive_tools}
# Our LLM doesn't have to know which nodes it has to route to. In its 'mind', it's just invoking functions.
part_3_assistant_runnable = assistant_prompt | llm.bind_tools(
    part_3_safe_tools + part_3_sensitive_tools

```

#### Define Graph

Now, create the graph. Our graph is almost identical to part 2 **except** we split out the tools into 2 separate nodes. We only interrupt before the tools that are actually making changes to the user's bookings.


```python
from typing import Literal

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.prebuilt import tools_condition

builder = StateGraph(State)


def user_info(state: State):
    return {"user_info": fetch_user_flight_information.invoke({})}


# NEW: The fetch_user_info node runs first, meaning our assistant can see the user's flight information without
# having to take an action
builder.add_node("fetch_user_info", user_info)
builder.add_edge(START, "fetch_user_info")
builder.add_node("assistant", Assistant(part_3_assistant_runnable))
builder.add_node("safe_tools", create_tool_node_with_fallback(part_3_safe_tools))
builder.add_node(
    "sensitive_tools", create_tool_node_with_fallback(part_3_sensitive_tools)
)
# Define logic
builder.add_edge("fetch_user_info", "assistant")


def route_tools(state: State):
    next_node = tools_condition(state)
    # If no tools are invoked, return to the user
    if next_node == END:
        return END
    ai_message = state["messages"][-1]
    # This assumes single tool calls. To handle parallel tool calling, you'd want to
    # use an ANY condition
    first_tool_call = ai_message.tool_calls[0]
    if first_tool_call["name"] in sensitive_tool_names:
        return "sensitive_tools"
    return "safe_tools"


builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "assistant", route_tools, ["safe_tools", "sensitive_tools", END]
)
builder.add_edge("safe_tools", "assistant")
builder.add_edge("sensitive_tools", "assistant")

memory = MemorySaver()
part_3_graph = builder.compile(
    checkpointer=memory,
    # NEW: The graph will always halt before executing the "tools" node.
    # The user can approve or reject (or even alter the request) before
    # the assistant continues
    interrupt_before=["sensitive_tools"],
)
```


```python
from IPython.display import Image, display

try:
    display(Image(part_3_graph.get_graph(xray=True).draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass
```

#### Example Conversation

Now it's time to try out our newly revised chatbot! Let's run it over the following list of dialog turns. This time, we'll have many fewer confirmations.


```python
import shutil
import uuid

# Update with the backup file so we can restart from the original place in each section
db = update_dates(db)
thread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

config = {
    "configurable": {
        # The passenger_id is used in our flight tools to
        # fetch the user's flight information
        "passenger_id": "3442 587242",
        # Checkpoints are accessed by thread_id
        "thread_id": thread_id,
    }
}

tutorial_questions = [
    "Hi there, what time is my flight?",
    "Am i allowed to update my flight to something sooner? I want to leave later today.",
    "Update my flight to sometime next week then",
    "The next available option is great",
    "what about lodging and transportation?",
    "Yeah i think i'd like an affordable hotel for my week-long stay (7 days). And I'll want to rent a car.",
    "OK could you place a reservation for your recommended hotel? It sounds nice.",
    "yes go ahead and book anything that's moderate expense and has availability.",

    Here are some top recommendations for things to do in Basel:
    
    1. Basel Minster - This Gothic cathedral is a major landmark and architectural highlight of the city. You can explore the interior and climb to the top for panoramic views.
    
    2. Kunstmuseum Basel - One of the largest and most important museums in Switzerland, housing an impressive art collection from the 15th century to the present. 
    
    3. Basel Zoo - A great family-friendly activity, the Basel Zoo has exhibits with over 6,000 animals and 600 species.
    
    Some other potential options I could look into are day trips into nearby areas of Switzerland or France, guided city tours, museum passes, river cruises along the Rhine, or culinary experiences.

    ## Booking and Cancellation
    
    1. How can I change my booking?
    	* The ticket number must start with 724 (SWISS ticket no./plate).
    	* The ticket was not paid for by barter or voucher (there are exceptions to voucher payments; if the ticket was paid for in full by voucher, then it may be possible to rebook online under certain circumstances. If it is not possible to rebook online because of the payment method, then you will be informed accordingly during the rebooking process).
    	* There must be an active flight booking for your ticket. It is not possible to rebook open tickets or tickets without the corresponding flight segments online at the moment.
    	* It is currently only possible to rebook outbound (one-way) tickets or return tickets with single flight routes (point-to-point).
    2. Which tickets/bookings cannot be rebooked online currently?
    	* Bookings containing flight segments with other airlines
    	* Bookings containing reservations, where a ticket has not yet been issued
    	* Bookings with several valid tickets for the same person and route
    	* Tickets with a status other than O (open) (A)
    	* Bookings with segments with a status other than OK (e.g. containing flight segments with the status Waitlist) (HK|RR)
    	* Tickets that do not display the tariff calculation (IT tickets)
    	* Bookings that contain special services (e.g. transportation of animals/transportation of medica ... (truncated)

    The company policies don't mention any specific closures or restricted hours for the major Basel attractions like the Minster cathedral, Kunstmuseum art museum or the zoo during early May. 
    
    These seem to be year-round attractions that should be open and available to visit during your dates of May 2nd through 9th in Basel. The Basel Minster and museums may have slightly reduced hours on certain days, but barring any temporary closures, you should be able to visit and explore them while you're there.

    Unfortunately that broader search didn't return any additional museum options in Basel in my database. However, some other top museums I could recommend based on research include:
    
    - Basel Paper Mill Museum - Showcases the history of papermaking with working mills and exhibits
    - Museum of Cultures - Ethnographic museum with artifacts from around the world 
    - Cartoon Museum - Dedicated to comics, caricature and animated films
    
    The Kunstmuseum does seem to be the premier art museum, but Basel has several niche museums covering other cultural topics if you want some variety.

#### Part 3 Review

Much better! Our agent is now working well - [check out a LangSmith trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/a0d64d8b-1714-4cfe-a239-e170ca45e81a/r) of our latest run to inspect its work! You may be satisfied with this design. The code is contained, and it's behaving as desired. 

One problem with this design is that we're putting a lot of pressure on a single prompt. If we want to add more tools, or if each tool gets more complicated (more filters, more business logic constraining behavior, etc), it's likely the tool usage and overall behavior of the bot will start to suffer. 

In the next section, we show how you can take more control over different user experiences by routing to specialist agents or sub-graphs based on the user's intent.

## Part 4: Specialized Workflows

In the previous sections, we saw how "wide" chat-bots, relying on a single prompt and LLM to handle various user intents, can get us far. However, it's difficult to create **predictably great** user experiences for known intents with this approach.

Alternatively, your graph can detect userintent and select the appropriate workflow or "skill" to satisfy the user's needs. Each workflow can focus on its domain, allowing for isolated improvements without degrading the overall assistant.

In this section, we'll split user experiences into separate sub-graphs, resulting in a structure like this:

<img src="./img/part-4-diagram.png" src="../img/part-4-diagram.png">

In the diagram above, each square wraps an agentic, focused workflow. The primary assistant fields the user's initial queries, and the graph routes to the appropriate "expert" based on the query content.

#### State

We want to keep track of which sub-graph is in control at any given moment. While we _could_ do this through some arithmetic on the message list, it's easier to track as a dedicated **stack**. 

Add a `dialog_state` list to the `State` below. Any time a `node` is run and returns a value for `dialog_state`, the `update_dialog_stack` function will be called to determine how to apply the update.


```python
from typing import Annotated, Literal, Optional

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph.message import AnyMessage, add_messages


def update_dialog_stack(left: list[str], right: Optional[str]) -> list[str]:
    """Push or pop the state."""
    if right is None:
        return left
    if right == "pop":
        return left[:-1]
    return left + [right]


class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]
    user_info: str
    dialog_state: Annotated[
        list[
            Literal[
                "assistant",
                "update_flight",
                "book_car_rental",
                "book_hotel",
                "book_excursion",
            ]
        ],
        update_dialog_stack,
    ]
```

#### Assistants

This time we will create an assistant **for every workflow**. That means:

1. Flight booking assistant
2. Hotel booking assistant
3. Car rental assistant
4. Excursion assistant
5. and finally, a "primary assistant" to route between these

If you're paying attention, you may recognize this as an example of the **supervisor** design pattern from our Multi-agent examples.

Below, define the `Runnable` objects to power each assistant.
Each `Runnable` has a prompt, LLM, and schemas for the tools scoped to that assistant.
Each *specialized* / delegated assistant additionally can call the `CompleteOrEscalate` tool to indicate that the control flow should be passed back to the primary assistant. This happens if it has successfully completed its work or if the user has changed their mind or needs assistance on something that beyond the scope of that particular workflow.

```

#### Create Assistant

We're about ready to create the graph. In the previous section, we made the design decision to have a shared `messages` state between all the nodes. This is powerful in that each delegated assistant can see the entire user journey and have a shared context. This, however, means that weaker LLMs can easily get mixed up about there specific scope. To mark the "handoff" between the primary assistant and one of the delegated workflows (and complete the tool call from the router), we will add a `ToolMessage` to the state.


#### Utility

Create a function to make an "entry" node for each workflow, stating "the current assistant ix `assistant_name`".


```python
from typing import Callable

from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage


def create_entry_node(assistant_name: str, new_dialog_state: str) -> Callable:
    def entry_node(state: State) -> dict:
        tool_call_id = state["messages"][-1].tool_calls[0]["id"]
        return {
            "messages": [
                ToolMessage(
                    content=f"The assistant is now the {assistant_name}. Reflect on the above conversation between the host assistant and the user."
                    f" The user's intent is unsatisfied. Use the provided tools to assist the user. Remember, you are {assistant_name},"
                    " and the booking, update, other other action is not complete until after you have successfully invoked the appropriate tool."
                    " If the user changes their mind or needs help for other tasks, call the CompleteOrEscalate function to let the primary host assistant take control."
                    " Do not mention who you are - just act as the proxy for the assistant.",
                    tool_call_id=tool_call_id,
                )
            ],
            "dialog_state": new_dialog_state,
        }

    return entry_node
```

#### Define Graph

Now it's time to start building our graph. As before, we'll start with a node to pre-populate the state with the user's current information.


```python
from typing import Literal

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.prebuilt import tools_condition

builder = StateGraph(State)


def user_info(state: State):
    return {"user_info": fetch_user_flight_information.invoke({})}


builder.add_node("fetch_user_info", user_info)
builder.add_edge(START, "fetch_user_info")
```

Now we'll start adding our specialized workflows. Each mini-workflow looks very similar to our full graph in [Part 3](#part-3-conditional-interrupt), employing 5 nodes:

1. `enter_*`: use the `create_entry_node` utility you defined above to add a ToolMessage signaling that the new specialized assistant is at the helm
2. Assistant: the prompt + llm combo that takes in the current state and either uses a tool, asks a question of the user, or ends the workflow (return to the primary assistant)
3. `*_safe_tools`: "read-only" tools the assistant can use without user confirmation.
4. `*_sensitive_tools`: tools with "write" access that require user confirmation (and will be assigned an `interrupt_before` when we compile the graph)
5. `leave_skill`: _pop_ the `dialog_state` to signal that the *primary assistant* is back in control

Because of their similarities, we _could_ define a factory function to generate these. Since this is a tutorial, we'll define them each explicitly.

First, make the **flight booking assistant** dedicated to managing the user journey for updating and canceling flights.


```python
# Flight booking assistant
builder.add_node(
    "enter_update_flight",
    create_entry_node("Flight Updates & Booking Assistant", "update_flight"),
)
builder.add_node("update_flight", Assistant(update_flight_runnable))
builder.add_edge("enter_update_flight", "update_flight")
builder.add_node(
    "update_flight_sensitive_tools",
    create_tool_node_with_fallback(update_flight_sensitive_tools),
)
builder.add_node(
    "update_flight_safe_tools",
    create_tool_node_with_fallback(update_flight_safe_tools),
)


def route_update_flight(
    state: State,
):
    route = tools_condition(state)
    if route == END:
        return END
    tool_calls = state["messages"][-1].tool_calls
    did_cancel = any(tc["name"] == CompleteOrEscalate.__name__ for tc in tool_calls)
    if did_cancel:
        return "leave_skill"
    safe_toolnames = [t.name for t in update_flight_safe_tools]
    if all(tc["name"] in safe_toolnames for tc in tool_calls):
        return "update_flight_safe_tools"
    return "update_flight_sensitive_tools"


builder.add_edge("update_flight_sensitive_tools", "update_flight")
builder.add_edge("update_flight_safe_tools", "update_flight")
builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "update_flight",
    route_update_flight,
    ["update_flight_sensitive_tools", "update_flight_safe_tools", "leave_skill", END],
)


# This node will be shared for exiting all specialized assistants
def pop_dialog_state(state: State) -> dict:
    """Pop the dialog stack and return to the main assistant.

    This lets the full graph explicitly track the dialog flow and delegate control
    to specific sub-graphs.
    """
    messages = []
    if state["messages"][-1].tool_calls:
        # Note: Doesn't currently handle the edge case where the llm performs parallel tool calls
        messages.append(
            ToolMessage(
                content="Resuming dialog with the host assistant. Please reflect on the past conversation and assist the user as needed.",
                tool_call_id=state["messages"][-1].tool_calls[0]["id"],
            )
        )
    return {
        "dialog_state": "pop",
        "messages": messages,
    }


builder.add_node("leave_skill", pop_dialog_state)
builder.add_edge("leave_skill", "primary_assistant")
```

Next, create the **car rental assistant** graph to own all car rental needs.


```python
# Car rental assistant

builder.add_node(
    "enter_book_car_rental",
    create_entry_node("Car Rental Assistant", "book_car_rental"),
)
builder.add_node("book_car_rental", Assistant(book_car_rental_runnable))
builder.add_edge("enter_book_car_rental", "book_car_rental")
builder.add_node(
    "book_car_rental_safe_tools",
    create_tool_node_with_fallback(book_car_rental_safe_tools),
)
builder.add_node(
    "book_car_rental_sensitive_tools",
    create_tool_node_with_fallback(book_car_rental_sensitive_tools),
)


def route_book_car_rental(
    state: State,
):
    route = tools_condition(state)
    if route == END:
        return END
    tool_calls = state["messages"][-1].tool_calls
    did_cancel = any(tc["name"] == CompleteOrEscalate.__name__ for tc in tool_calls)
    if did_cancel:
        return "leave_skill"
    safe_toolnames = [t.name for t in book_car_rental_safe_tools]
    if all(tc["name"] in safe_toolnames for tc in tool_calls):
        return "book_car_rental_safe_tools"
    return "book_car_rental_sensitive_tools"


builder.add_edge("book_car_rental_sensitive_tools", "book_car_rental")
builder.add_edge("book_car_rental_safe_tools", "book_car_rental")
builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "book_car_rental",
    route_book_car_rental,
    [
        "book_car_rental_safe_tools",
        "book_car_rental_sensitive_tools",
        "leave_skill",
        END,
    ],
)
```

Then define the **hotel booking** workflow.


```python
# Hotel booking assistant
builder.add_node(
    "enter_book_hotel", create_entry_node("Hotel Booking Assistant", "book_hotel")
)
builder.add_node("book_hotel", Assistant(book_hotel_runnable))
builder.add_edge("enter_book_hotel", "book_hotel")
builder.add_node(
    "book_hotel_safe_tools",
    create_tool_node_with_fallback(book_hotel_safe_tools),
)
builder.add_node(
    "book_hotel_sensitive_tools",
    create_tool_node_with_fallback(book_hotel_sensitive_tools),
)


def route_book_hotel(
    state: State,
):
    route = tools_condition(state)
    if route == END:
        return END
    tool_calls = state["messages"][-1].tool_calls
    did_cancel = any(tc["name"] == CompleteOrEscalate.__name__ for tc in tool_calls)
    if did_cancel:
        return "leave_skill"
    tool_names = [t.name for t in book_hotel_safe_tools]
    if all(tc["name"] in tool_names for tc in tool_calls):
        return "book_hotel_safe_tools"
    return "book_hotel_sensitive_tools"


builder.add_edge("book_hotel_sensitive_tools", "book_hotel")
builder.add_edge("book_hotel_safe_tools", "book_hotel")
builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "book_hotel",
    route_book_hotel,
    ["leave_skill", "book_hotel_safe_tools", "book_hotel_sensitive_tools", END],
)
```

After that, define the **excursion assistant**.


```python
# Excursion assistant
builder.add_node(
    "enter_book_excursion",
    create_entry_node("Trip Recommendation Assistant", "book_excursion"),

    For your car rental needs in Basel from May 4th to May 11th, I was able to find availability for a midsize vehicle from Thrifty. The total rate for the 8 day rental comes out to $425, which fits the moderate pricing you requested.
    
    Does the midsize rental from Thrifty work for you? If so, I can go ahead and confirm that booking. Or if you need me to look at any other rental car options in Basel for those dates, just let me know.

    Now for a car, what are my options?
    ==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
    
    For your rental car in Basel from May 4th to May 11th, here are a couple of the available options I found:
    
    Midsize Vehicle from Thrifty
    - Vehicle Class: Midsize (e.g. Toyota Corolla or similar)
    - Pick-up/Drop-off: Basel Airport or City locations
    - Total Rate: $425 for 8 days
    
    Economy Vehicle from Europcar
    - Vehicle Class: Economy (e.g. Volkswagen Polo or similar) 
    - Pick-up/Drop-off: Basel Airport or City locations
    - Total Rate: $375 for 8 days
    
    I can provide some additional details on those rentals from Thrifty and Europcar if needed. The Thrifty midsize option was around $425 total, while the Europcar economy option is a bit less at $375 total for your dates.
    
    Let me know if either of those rental options work for your needs in Basel. Or if you had a different vehicle class or rental company preference, I'm happy to check on additional availability as well. Just provide any other requirements you have for the rental car and I can get you some updated options.

    Unfortunately I was unable to find any available guided hiking or biking tours through the vineyards and countryside around Basel for your specific travel dates of May 4th - 11th. It seems many of those tours may not be fully operating until later in the spring/summer season.
    
    Since getting an outdoor excursion was important to you, I have a couple options:
    
    1) I can look into other outdoor activity recommendations in Basel for early May, like city walking tours, park visits, river cruises, etc. 
    
    2) If a vineyard/countryside hiking or biking tour is a top priority, I can check availability for later dates when those seasonal offerings are more active.
    
    Let me know which direction you'd prefer - exploring alternative outdoor options for your May dates, or pushing the vineyard tour to later in the season. I'm happy to adjust my recommendation either way to find something fitting your interests.
