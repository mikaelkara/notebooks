# How to use Inference Endpoints to Embed Documents

_Authored by: [Derek Thomas](https://huggingface.co/derek-thomas)_

## Goal
I have a dataset I want to embed for semantic search (or QA, or RAG), I want the easiest way to do embed this and put it in a new dataset.

## Approach
I'm using a dataset from my favorite subreddit [r/bestofredditorupdates](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestofredditorupdates/). Because it has long entries, I will use the new [jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en) since it has an 8k context length. I will deploy this using [Inference Endpoint](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints) to save time and money. To follow this tutorial, you will need to **have already added a payment method**. If you haven't, you can add one here in [billing](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/billing#billing). To make it even easier, I'll make this fully API based.

To make this MUCH faster I will use the [Text Embeddings Inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference) image. This has many benefits like:
- No model graph compilation step
- Small docker images and fast boot times. Get ready for true serverless!
- Token based dynamic batching
- Optimized transformers code for inference using Flash Attention, Candle and cuBLASLt
- Safetensors weight loading
- Production ready (distributed tracing with Open Telemetry, Prometheus metrics)

## Requirements


```python
!pip install -q aiohttp==3.8.3 datasets==2.14.6 pandas==1.5.3 requests==2.31.0 tqdm==4.66.1 huggingface-hub>=0.20
```

## Imports


```python
import asyncio
from getpass import getpass
import json
from pathlib import Path
import time
from typing import Optional

from aiohttp import ClientSession, ClientTimeout
from datasets import load_dataset, Dataset, DatasetDict
from huggingface_hub import notebook_login, create_inference_endpoint, list_inference_endpoints, whoami
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import requests
from tqdm.auto import tqdm
```

## Config
`DATASET_IN` is where your text data is
`DATASET_OUT` is where your embeddings will be stored

Note I used 5 for the `MAX_WORKERS` since `jina-embeddings-v2` are quite memory hungry. 


```python
DATASET_IN = 'derek-thomas/dataset-creator-reddit-bestofredditorupdates'
DATASET_OUT = "processed-subset-bestofredditorupdates"
ENDPOINT_NAME = "boru-jina-embeddings-demo-ie"

MAX_WORKERS = 5  # This is for how many async workers you want. Choose based on the model and hardware 
ROW_COUNT = 100  # Choose None to use all rows, Im using 100 just for a demo
```

Inference Endpoints offers a number of GPUs that you can choose from. Check the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/en/pricing#gpu-instances) for GPU and alternative accelerators for information.

# Inference Endpoints
## Create Inference Endpoint
We are going to use the [API](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/api_reference) to create an [Inference Endpoint](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints). This should provide a few main benefits:
- It's convenient (No clicking)
- It's repeatable (We have the code to run it easily)
- It's cheaper (No time spent waiting for it to load, and automatically shut it down)




```python
try:
    endpoint = create_inference_endpoint(
        ENDPOINT_NAME,
        repository="jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en",
        revision="7302ac470bed880590f9344bfeee32ff8722d0e5",
        task="sentence-embeddings",
        framework="pytorch",
        accelerator="gpu",
        instance_size=INSTANCE_SIZE,
        instance_type=INSTANCE_TYPE,
        region=REGION,
        vendor=VENDOR,
        namespace=namespace,
        custom_image={
            "health_route": "/health",
            "env": {
                "MAX_BATCH_TOKENS": str(MAX_WORKERS * 2048),
                "MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS": "512",
                "MODEL_ID": "/repository"
            },
            "url": "ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:0.5.0",
        },
        type="protected",
    )
except:
    endpoint = [ie for ie in list_inference_endpoints(namespace=namespace) if ie.name == ENDPOINT_NAME][0]
    print('Loaded endpoint')
```

There are a few design choices here:
- As discussed before we are using `jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en` as our model. 
    - For reproducibility we are pinning it to a specific revision.
- If you are interested in more models, check out the supported list [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-embeddings-inference/supported_models). 
    - Note that most embedding models are based on the BERT architecture.
- `MAX_BATCH_TOKENS` is chosen based on our number of workers and the context window of our embedding model.
- `type="protected"` utilized the security from Inference Endpoints detailed here.
- I'm using **1x Nvidia A10** since `jina-embeddings-v2` is memory hungry (remember the 8k context length). 
- You should consider further tuning `MAX_BATCH_TOKENS` and `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` if you have high workloads


## Wait until it's running


```python
%%time
endpoint.wait()
```

    CPU times: user 48.1 ms, sys: 15.7 ms, total: 63.8 ms
    Wall time: 52.6 s
    




    InferenceEndpoint(name='boru-jina-embeddings-demo-ie', namespace='HF-test-lab', repository='jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en', status='running', url='https://k7l1xeok1jwnpbx5.us-east-1.aws.endpoints.huggingface.cloud')



When we use `endpoint.client.post` we get a bytes string back. This is a little tedious because we need to convert this to an `np.array`, but it's just a couple quick lines in python.


```python
response = endpoint.client.post(json={"inputs": 'This sound track was beautiful! It paints the senery in your mind so well I would recomend it even to people who hate vid. game music!', 'truncate': True}, task="feature-extraction")
response = np.array(json.loads(response.decode()))
response[0][:20]
```




    array([-0.05630935, -0.03560849,  0.02789049,  0.02792823, -0.02800371,
           -0.01530391, -0.01863454, -0.0077982 ,  0.05374297,  0.03672185,
           -0.06114018, -0.06880157, -0.0093503 , -0.03174005, -0.03206085,
            0.0610647 ,  0.02243694,  0.03217408,  0.04181686,  0.00248854])



You may have inputs that exceed the context. In such scenarios, it's up to you to handle them. In my case, I'd like to truncate rather than have an error. Let's test that it works.


```python
embedding_input = 'This input will get multiplied' * 10000
print(f'The length of the embedding_input is: {len(embedding_input)}')
response = endpoint.client.post(json={"inputs": embedding_input, 'truncate': True}, task="feature-extraction")
response = np.array(json.loads(response.decode()))
response[0][:20]
```

    The length of the embedding_input is: 300000
    




    array([-0.03088215, -0.0351537 ,  0.05749275,  0.00983467,  0.02108356,
            0.04539965,  0.06107162, -0.02536954,  0.03887688,  0.01998681,
           -0.05391388,  0.01529677, -0.1279156 ,  0.01653782, -0.01940958,
            0.0367411 ,  0.0031748 ,  0.04716022, -0.00713609, -0.00155313])



# Get Embeddings

Here I send a document, update it with the embedding, and return it. This happens in parallel with `MAX_WORKERS`.


```python
async def request(document, semaphore):
    # Semaphore guard
    async with semaphore:
        result = await endpoint.async_client.post(json={"inputs": document['content'], 'truncate': True}, task="feature-extraction")
        result = np.array(json.loads(result.decode()))
        document['embedding'] = result[0]  # Assuming the API's output can be directly assigned
        return document

async def main(documents):
    # Semaphore to limit concurrent requests. Adjust the number as needed.
    semaphore = asyncio.BoundedSemaphore(MAX_WORKERS)

    # Creating a list of tasks
    tasks = [request(document, semaphore) for document in documents]
    
    # Using tqdm to show progress. It's been integrated into the async loop.
    for f in tqdm(asyncio.as_completed(tasks), total=len(documents)):
        await f
```


```python
start = time.perf_counter()

# Get embeddings
await main(documents)

# Make sure we got it all
count = 0
for document in documents:
    if 'embedding' in document.keys() and len(document['embedding']) == 768:
        count += 1
print(f'Embeddings = {count} documents = {len(documents)}')

            
# Print elapsed time
elapsed_time = time.perf_counter() - start
minutes, seconds = divmod(elapsed_time, 60)
print(f"{int(minutes)} min {seconds:.2f} sec")
```


      0%|          | 0/100 [00:00<?, ?it/s]


    Embeddings = 100 documents = 100
    0 min 21.33 sec
    

## Pause Inference Endpoint
Now that we have finished, let's pause the endpoint so we don't incur any extra charges, this will also allow us to analyze the cost.


```python
endpoint = endpoint.pause()

print(f"Endpoint Status: {endpoint.status}")
```

    Endpoint Status: paused
    

# Push updated dataset to Hub
We now have our documents updated with the embeddings we wanted. First we need to convert it back to a `Dataset` format. I find it easiest to go from list of dicts -> `pd.DataFrame` -> `Dataset`


```python
df = pd.DataFrame(documents)
dd = DatasetDict({'train': Dataset.from_pandas(df)})
```

I'm uploading it to the user's account by default (as opposed to uploading to an organization) but feel free to push to wherever you want by setting the user in the `repo_id` or in the config by setting `DATASET_OUT`


```python
dd.push_to_hub(repo_id=DATASET_OUT)
```


    Pushing dataset shards to the dataset hub:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]



    Downloading metadata:   0%|          | 0.00/823 [00:00<?, ?B/s]



```python
print(f'Dataset is at https://huggingface.co/datasets/{who["name"]}/{DATASET_OUT}')
```

    Dataset is at https://huggingface.co/datasets/derek-thomas/processed-subset-bestofredditorupdates
    

# Analyze Usage
1. Go to your `dashboard_url` printed below
1. Click on the Usage & Cost tab
1. See how much you have spent


```python
dashboard_url = f'https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/{namespace}/endpoints/{ENDPOINT_NAME}'
print(dashboard_url)
```

    https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/HF-test-lab/endpoints/boru-jina-embeddings-demo-ie
    


```python
input("Hit enter to continue with the notebook")
```

    Hit enter to continue with the notebook 
    




    ''



We can see that it only took `$0.04` to pay for this!



# Delete Endpoint
Now that we are done, we don't need our endpoint anymore. We can delete our endpoint programmatically. 

![Cost](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/cookbook-images/resolve/main/automatic_embedding_tei_inference_endpoints.png)


```python
endpoint = endpoint.delete()

if not endpoint:
    print('Endpoint deleted successfully')
else:
    print('Delete Endpoint in manually') 
```

    Endpoint deleted successfully
