## Role in AI and Language Models

Prompt engineering plays a crucial role in enhancing the performance and applicability of AI and language models. It helps in:

1. Tailoring model outputs to specific needs
2. Improving the accuracy and relevance of responses
3. Enabling complex task completion
4. Reducing biases and improving fairness in AI outputs

Let's explore how prompt engineering can help in overcoming some limitations of language models:


```python
fact_check_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["statement"],
    template="""Evaluate the following statement for factual accuracy. If it's incorrect, provide the correct information:
    Statement: {statement}
    Evaluation:"""
)

chain = fact_check_prompt | llm
print(chain.invoke("The capital of France is London.").content)
```

    Evaluation: The statement is incorrect. The capital of France is Paris, not London.
    

### Improving Complex Problem-Solving

Prompt engineering can also help in breaking down complex problems and guiding the model through a step-by-step reasoning process:


```python
problem_solving_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["problem"],
    template="""Solve the following problem step by step:
    Problem: {problem}
    Solution:
    1)"""
)

chain = problem_solving_prompt | llm
print(chain.invoke("Calculate the compound interest on $1000 invested for 5 years at an annual rate of 5%, compounded annually.").content)
```

    To calculate the compound interest on an investment, we can use the formula for compound interest:
    
    \[
    A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}
    \]
    
    Where:
    - \( A \) = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
    - \( P \) = the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
    - \( r \) = annual interest rate (decimal).
    - \( n \) = number of times that interest is compounded per year.
    - \( t \) = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed.
    
    In this problem:
    - \( P = 1000 \) (the principal amount)
    - \( r = 0.05 \) (5% annual interest rate expressed as a decimal)
    - \( n = 1 \) (interest is compounded annually)
    - \( t = 5 \) (the number of years)
    
    Now, we will calculate step by step:
    
    ### Step 1: Substitute the values into the formula
    
    \[
    A = 1000 \left(1 + \frac{0.05}{1}\right)^{1 \times 5}
    \]
    
    ### Step 2: Simplify the expression inside the parentheses
    
    \[
    A = 1000 \left(1 + 0.05\right)^{5}
    \]
    \[
    A = 1000 \left(1.05\right)^{5}
    \]
    
    ### Step 3: Calculate \( (1.05)^{5} \)
    
    Using a calculator or by manual computation:
    \[
    (1.05)^{5} \approx 1.2762815625
    \]
    
    ### Step 4: Multiply by the principal amount
    
    Now, we substitute back to find \( A \):
    
    \[
    A = 1000 \times 1.2762815625 \approx 1276.28
    \]
    
    ### Step 5: Calculate the compound interest
    
    The compound interest can be found by subtracting the principal from the total amount:
    
    \[
    \text{Compound Interest} = A - P
    \]
    \[
    \text{Compound Interest} = 1276.28 - 1000 \approx 276.28
    \]
    
    ### Final Result
    
    The compound interest on $1000 invested for 5 years at an annual rate of 5%, compounded annually, is approximately **$276.28**.
