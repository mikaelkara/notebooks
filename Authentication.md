The Gemini API uses API keys for authentication. This notebook walks you through creating an API key, and using it with the Python SDK or a command line tool like `curl`.

## Create an API key

You can [create](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) your API key using Google AI Studio with a single click.  

Remember to treat your API key like a password. Do not accidentally save it in a notebook or source file you later commit to GitHub. This notebook shows you two ways you can securely store your API key.

* If you are using Google Colab, it is recommended to store your key in Colab Secrets.

* If you are using a different development environment (or calling the Gemini API through `cURL` in your terminal), it is recommended to store your key in an environment variable.

Let's start with Colab Secrets.

## Add your key to Colab Secrets

Add your API key to the Colab Secrets manager to securely store it.

1. Open your Google Colab notebook and click on the ðŸ”‘ **Secrets** tab in the left panel.
   
   <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/images/secrets.jpg" alt="The Secrets tab is found on the left panel." width=50%>

2. Create a new secret with the name `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
3. Copy/paste your API key into the `Value` input box of `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
4. Toggle the button on the left to allow notebook access to the secret.


## Install the Python SDK


```
!pip install -U -q "google-generativeai>=0.7.2"
```

## Configure the SDK with your API key

You'll call `genai.configure` with your API key, but instead of pasting your key into the notebook, you'll read it from Colab Secrets.


```
import google.generativeai as genai
from google.colab import userdata

GOOGLE_API_KEY=userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
```

And that's it! Now you're ready to call the Gemini API.


```
model = genai.GenerativeModel('models/gemini-1.5-flash')
response = model.generate_content("Please give me python code to sort a list.")
print(response.text)
```

    ```python
    def sort_list(list_to_sort):
      """
      Sorts a list using the built-in sort method.
    
      Args:
        list_to_sort: The list to be sorted.
    
      Returns:
        The sorted list.
      """
    
      list_to_sort.sort()
      return list_to_sort
    
    # Example usage:
    my_list = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]
    
    sorted_list = sort_list(my_list)
    
    print(f"Original list: {my_list}")
    print(f"Sorted list: {sorted_list}")
    ```
    
    **Explanation:**
    
    * **`sort_list(list_to_sort)` function:**
        * Takes a list as input (`list_to_sort`).
        * Uses the built-in `sort()` method to sort the list in ascending order.
        * Returns the sorted list.
    
    * **Example usage:**
        * Creates a sample list `my_list`.
        * Calls `sort_list()` to sort the list and store the result in `sorted_list`.
        * Prints both the original and sorted lists.
    
    **Output:**
    
    ```
    Original list: [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]
    Sorted list: [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]
    ```
    
    **Other sorting methods:**
    
    * **`sorted()` function:** This function creates a new sorted list without modifying the original list.
    
    ```python
    sorted_list = sorted(my_list)
    ```
    
    * **Custom sorting:** You can use the `sort()` method with a `key` function to specify a custom sorting criteria.
    
    ```python
    my_list.sort(key=lambda x: -x) # Sort in descending order
    ```
    
    Choose the method that best suits your needs.
    
    

## Store your key in an environment variable

If you are using a different development environment (or calling the Gemini API through `cURL` in your terminal), it is recommended to store your key in an environment variable.

To store your key in an environment variable, open your terminal and run:

```export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"```

If you are using Python, add these two lines to your notebook to read the key:

```
import os
genai.configure(api_key=os.environ['GOOGLE_API_KEY'])
```

Or, if you're calling the API through your terminal using `cURL`, you can copy and paste this code to read your key from the environment variable.

```
curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent?key=$GOOGLE_API_KEY" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -X POST \
    -d '{
      "contents": [{
        "parts":[{
          "text": "Please give me Python code to sort a list."}]}]}'
```


## Learning more

The Gemini API uses API keys for most types of authentication, and thatâ€™s all you need to get started. You can use OAuth for more advanced authentication when tuning models. You can learn more about that in the [OAuth quickstart](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Authentication_with_OAuth.ipynb).
