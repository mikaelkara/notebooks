# GPT Action Library: Jira

## Introduction

This page provides an instruction & guide for developers building a GPT Action for a specific application. Before you proceed, make sure to first familiarize yourself with the following information: 
- [Introduction to GPT Actions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions)
- [Introduction to GPT Actions Library](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/actions-library)
- [Example of Buliding a GPT Action from Scratch](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/getting-started)

This particular GPT Action provides an overview of how to connect to Jira, Atlassian's tool for project and ticket management. This action assumes a userâ€™s context and allows them to read and write to issues in a given project.

### Value + Example Business Use Cases

**Value**: Users can now leverage ChatGPT's natural language capability to connect directly to Jira Cloud

**Example Use Cases**: 
- A user can load up recent issues for a particular project and use ChatGPT to provide solutions
- A user can create and alter issues and sub-tasks and assign to specific users by instructing ChatGPT

## Application Information

### Application Key Links

- Application Website: https://<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.atlassian.net/jira
- Application API Documentation: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/intro/
- Application OAuth 2.0 Documentation: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/

### Application Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you go through the following steps in your application environment:
- Ensure you have the access and permissions to create an application in the [Atlassian Cloud Developer Console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/)

### Custom GPT Instructions 

Once you've created a Custom GPT, copy the text below in the Instructions panel. Have questions? Check out [Getting Started Example](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/getting-started) to see how this step works in more detail.


```python
**Context**: you are specialized GPT designed to create and edit issues through API connections to Jira Cloud. This GPT can create, read, and edit project issues based on user instructions.

**Instructions**:
- When asked to perform a task, use the available actions via the api.atlassian.com API.
- When asked to create an issue, use the user's input to synthesize a summary and description and file the issue in JIRA.
- When asked to create a subtask, assume the project key and parent issue key of the currently discussed issue. Clarify with if this context is not available.
- When asked to assign an issue or task to the user, first use jql to query the current user's profile and use this account as the assignee. 
- Ask for clarification when needed to ensure accuracy and completeness in fulfilling user requests.

## Authentication Instructions

Below are instructions on setting up authentication with Jira. Have questions? Check out [Getting Started Example](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/getting-started) to see how this step works in more detail.


### Jira Steps

1. <b>Create an Application</b>: The first step is to create a new application in Jira for the integration with ChatGPT. This can be done by visiting the [Atlassian Developer Console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/), Clicking **Create** and selecting **OAuth 2.0 Integration**. 

![gptactions_jira_devconsole.png](../../../images/gptactions_jira_devconsole.png)

From here, simply enter the name of your integration and click **Create**.

![gptactions_jira_newapplication.png](../../../images/gptactions_jira_newapplication.png)

2. <b>Define Permissions</b>: Next we need to provide the required permissions to our application. Within the new application, open the **Permissions** menu from the sidebar, locate **Jira API** and click **Add** and then **Configure**.

![gptactions_jira_permissions.png](../../../images/gptactions_jira_permissions.png)

Required permissions will vary depending on the intended functionality of the GPT. In this scenario we wish to read and write to Jira issues, so select the following scopes under **Jira platform REST API** by clicking **Edit Scopes**:

- read:jira-work
- write:jira-work
- read:jira-user

Once selected, click **Save**

![gptactions_jira_scopes.png](../../../images/gptactions_jira_scopes.png)

3. <b>Configure Placeholder Callback URL</b>: In order to complete the following step and obtain a **Client ID** and **Secret** for enabling secure authentication between ChatGPT and Jira, we first need to add a placeholder callback URL. We can achieve this by clicking on **Authorization** in the sidebar, and **Configure** next to **OAuth 2.0 (3LO)**. From here simply enter a placeholder URL and click **Save Changes**.


![gptactions_jira_placeholder.png](../../../images/gptactions_jira_placeholder.png)

4. <b>Application Client ID/Secret</b>: The next step is to locate the **Client ID** and **Secret** for enabling secure authentication between ChatGPT and Jira. We can find these values by clicking on **Settings** in the sidebar and scrolling down to **Authentication Details**. 

      Keep this page open as we will require these values in the next stage of configuration!

![gptactions_jira_clientsecret.png](../../../images/gptactions_jira_clientsecret.png)

### In ChatGPT

In ChatGPT, click on "Authentication" and choose **"OAuth"**. Enter in the information below. 

- **Client ID**: The **Client ID** from **Step 3** of Jira Configuration
- **Client Secret**: The **Secret** from **Step 3** of Jira Configuration
- **Authorization URL**: https://auth.atlassian.com/authorize
- **Token URL**: https://auth.atlassian.com/oauth/token
- **Scope**: read:jira-work write:jira-work read:jira-user 
- **Token Exchange Method**: Default (POST Request)

### Post-Action Steps

Once you've set up authentication in ChatGPT, follow the steps below in the application to finalize the Action. 

- Copy the callback URL from the GPT Action

![gptactions_jira_redirect.png](../../../images/gptactions_jira_redirect.png)

- In your application in the Atlassian Developer Console, navigate to the **Authorization** sidebar tab, next to **OAuth 2.0 (3L0)** click **Configure**, and add your callback URL under **Callback URL**


![gptactions_jira_callback.png](../../../images/gptactions_jira_callback.png)

### FAQ & Troubleshooting

- **Callback URL Error**: If you get a callback URL error in ChatGPT, double check the Callback URL value as it can occasionally change depending on any alterations made to the authentication
