# 1) create a project

The metadata for a project are stored in Azure Storage.
The metadata has the information:
    
1. name - project name
2. productCategory - category, a broad description of the text corpus.
3. productName - name, a description of the text corpus

The chat is broken into chunks of 50 lines and stored as a list of dicts, one dict per chunk. 
The list of dicts is stored in the variable **reviews**, an individual dict is called a **review**. We use the terms review and chunk interchangeably.
The mandatory keys for a review are:

1. **review_text** - stores 50 lines of chat as a string.

    


```python
# Create the project
project_name = "minecraft-1"

project_object = {
    "name" : project_name,
    "productCategory" : "minecraft",
    "productName" : "minecraft"
    }
print("Project metadata:")
print(json.dumps(project_object, indent = 4))

    
# Read in chunked chat data. Each chunk is called a review
reviews_filename = "sample_reviews/minecraft_synthetic_chat_with_numbers_snippets.json"
reviews = core_utils.json_load_from_filename(reviews_filename)
```

    Project metadata:
    {
        "name": "minecraft-1",
        "productCategory": "minecraft",
        "productName": "minecraft"
    }
    

# 2) Get Overall Summary of Text Corpus

An overall summary of the text corpus is generated in a batched manner.
Summary of each individual review / chunk is done, then these summaries are combined into an overall summary.
    
Summarization is done in this batched manner for two reasons:
1. To support corpus that is too large for a single prompt
2. To provide a summary for each review/chunk in the corpus. This provides a more nuanced set of summaries
    which are a check against omission of topics in the overall summary.


```python
overall_summary, batch_summaries = extract_summary_batched.summarize_reviews(reviews)
print("\n\nOverall summary of chat:")
print(overall_summary)
print("\n\nBatch summaries:")
print(json.dumps(batch_summaries, indent = 4))
```

    Summarize each chunk of the chat
    Starting 4 parallel jobs.
    Done
    
    
    Overall summary of chat:
    : Minecraft's latest update has added two new mobs, mooblooms and glow squids, which have been a great addition to the game. Mooblooms provide resources and add a new level of excitement, while glow squids add a new level of exploration. Both creatures are beloved by players.
    
    
    Batch summaries:
    [
        ": Glow squids and mooblooms are awesome additions to Minecraft! They provide unique experiences, resources, and lighting. #glowsquids #mooblooms #minecraft",
        ": People are loving the new mooblooms and glow squids in Minecraft! They are excited to explore the underwater world with the glow squids and use the mooblooms for farming and decorating. Some people prefer the glow squids over the mooblooms, but both mobs are making the game even better.",
        ": Mooblooms and glow squids are the two newest additions to Minecraft and they are both loved by players. Mooblooms provide resources and are cute, while glow squids provide light and add a new level of excitement to exploring the ocean.",
        ": The latest update to Minecraft has added two new creatures, mooblooms and glow squids, which have been a great addition to the game. Mooblooms provide resources and add a new level of excitement, while glow squids add a new level of exploration. Both creatures are beloved by players, who love their unique looks and the resources they provide."
    ]
    

# 3) Get the top topics    

We use the terms aspects and topics interchangeably.
1. Aspects are extracted for each review / chunk.
2. The frequency of each aspect across batches is calculated as a frequency score.
3. We retain the top 10 aspects (most frequent).


```python
    
project_object, top_aspects, top_aspects_counts = await extract_top_tags.get_top_aspects_from_reviews(project_object, reviews)
print("Aspect \t | Frequency")
print("_____________________")
for aspect, count in zip(top_aspects, top_aspects_counts):
    print(aspect + "\t| " + str(count))
```

# 4 Generate parsed version of the chat

Parsed version will be used for generating summary with references.
    
We expect the **review_text** to be of the form:
1. Delimited by \n
2. Prefixed by line number (unique across entire chat), Followed by : and then the text of that line


This **review_text** is parsed into a dict. Keys are the line numbers and values are the text of that line.
This **parsed_review_text** is used to look up references.


```python
# Convert review_text to parsed_review_text.
# parsed_review_text is a list of numbered comments. 
parsed_reviews = parse_reviews.parse_reviews(reviews)
```

# 5) Provide topic summaries with references


## a) Get lines relevant to topic

Given a topic, we ask GPT to generate line numbers for lines relevant to the topic.
By working with line numbers instead of the lines, we avoid hallucinations in retrived lines.
We use the parsed review_text to convert line numbers to line texts.
This is done for each chunk / review and combined to get all relevant lines. We get better performance when we extract lines chunk-by-chunk, rather than the entire corpus.    
    
    
## b) Summarize relevant lines, with references
 
 
Given a topic and lines that are relevant to the topic, extract dominant clusters of lines and summarize each cluster.

We use semantic clustering on relevant lines to get clusters that are:
    1. Semantically highly similar
    2. Have a significant size (number of lines in the cluster > top_cluster_size_threshold)
    
Clusters that satisfy these two properties are called dominant clusters. Dominant clusters capture the major information in the lines. The lines that dont belong to a dominant cluster have one off content and are discarded before summary.

Next, we summarize each dominant cluster and include the lines of that cluster as references for that summary. Since the dominant cluster is quite homogenous, the cluster lines and summary are both quite focussed. The cluster lines serve as reference to the summary or provide related context to it. Further, since the lines were extracted from the corpus via line numbers, they are reproduced verbatim and avoid hallucinations in the references.
