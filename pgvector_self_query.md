# PGVector (Postgres)

>[PGVector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) is a vector similarity search package for `Postgres` data base.

In the notebook, we'll demo the `SelfQueryRetriever` wrapped around a `PGVector` vector store.

## Creating a PGVector vector store
First we'll want to create a PGVector vector store and seed it with some data. We've created a small demo set of documents that contain summaries of movies.

**Note:** The self-query retriever requires you to have `lark` installed (`pip install lark`). We also need the `` package.


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  lark pgvector psycopg2-binary
```

We want to use `OpenAIEmbeddings` so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.


```python
import getpass
import os

if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")
```


```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import PGVector
from langchain_core.documents import Document
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

collection = "Name of your collection"
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
```


```python
docs = [
    Document(
        page_content="A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose",
        metadata={"year": 1993, "rating": 7.7, "genre": "science fiction"},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a dream within a ...",
        metadata={"year": 2010, "director": "Christopher Nolan", "rating": 8.2},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea",
        metadata={"year": 2006, "director": "Satoshi Kon", "rating": 8.6},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them",
        metadata={"year": 2019, "director": "Greta Gerwig", "rating": 8.3},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="Toys come alive and have a blast doing so",
        metadata={"year": 1995, "genre": "animated"},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone",
        metadata={
            "year": 1979,
            "director": "Andrei Tarkovsky",
            "genre": "science fiction",
            "rating": 9.9,
        },
    ),
]
vectorstore = PGVector.from_documents(
    docs,
    embeddings,
    collection_name=collection,
)
```

## Creating our self-querying retriever
Now we can instantiate our retriever. To do this we'll need to provide some information upfront about the metadata fields that our documents support and a short description of the document contents.


```python
from langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import AttributeInfo
from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

metadata_field_info = [
    AttributeInfo(
        name="genre",
        description="The genre of the movie",
        type="string or list[string]",
    ),
    AttributeInfo(
        name="year",
        description="The year the movie was released",
        type="integer",
    ),
    AttributeInfo(
        name="director",
        description="The name of the movie director",
        type="string",
    ),
    AttributeInfo(
        name="rating", description="A 1-10 rating for the movie", type="float"
    ),
]
document_content_description = "Brief summary of a movie"
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm, vectorstore, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True
)
```

## Testing it out
And now we can try actually using our retriever!


```python
# This example only specifies a relevant query
retriever.invoke("What are some movies about dinosaurs")
```


```python
# This example only specifies a filter
retriever.invoke("I want to watch a movie rated higher than 8.5")
```


```python
# This example specifies a query and a filter
retriever.invoke("Has Greta Gerwig directed any movies about women")
```


```python
# This example specifies a composite filter
retriever.invoke("What's a highly rated (above 8.5) science fiction film?")
```


```python
# This example specifies a query and composite filter
retriever.invoke(
    "What's a movie after 1990 but before 2005 that's all about toys, and preferably is animated"
)
```

## Filter k

We can also use the self query retriever to specify `k`: the number of documents to fetch.

We can do this by passing `enable_limit=True` to the constructor.


```python
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm,
    vectorstore,
    document_content_description,
    metadata_field_info,
    enable_limit=True,
    verbose=True,
)
```


```python
# This example only specifies a relevant query
retriever.invoke("what are two movies about dinosaurs")
```
