# GPT Action Library: BigQuery

## Introduction

This page provides an instruction & guide for developers building a GPT Action for a specific application. Before you proceed, make sure to first familiarize yourself with the following information: 
- [Introduction to GPT Actions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions)
- [Introduction to GPT Actions Library](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/actions-library)
- [Example of Building a GPT Action from Scratch](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/getting-started)

This particular GPT Action provides an overview of how to connect to **Google BigQuery**, Google Cloud's Analytical Data Warehouse. This Action takes a user’s question, scans the relevant tables to gather the data schema, then writes a SQL query to answer the user’s question. 

Note: these instructions return back a functioning SQL statement, rather than the result itself. Currently middleware is required to return back a CSV file – we’ll be posting instructions on an example of that soon

### Value + Example Business Use Cases

**Value**: Users can now leverage ChatGPT's natural language capability to connect directly to BigQuery's DWH. 

**Example Use Cases**: 
- Data scientists can connect to tables and run data analyses using ChatGPT's Data Analysis
- Citizen data users can ask basic questions of their transactional data
- Users gain more visibility into their data & potential anomalies

## Application Information

### Application Key Links

Check out these links from the application before you get started:
- Application Website: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery 
- Application API Documentation: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest 

### Application Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you go through the following steps in your application environment:
- Set up a GCP project 
- Set up a BQ dataset in that GCP project
- Ensure that the user authenticating into BigQuery via ChatGPT has access to that BQ dataset 

## ChatGPT Steps

### Custom GPT Instructions 

Once you've created a Custom GPT, copy the text below in the Instructions panel. Have questions? Check out [Getting Started Example](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/getting-started) to see how this step works in more detail.


```python
**Context**: You are an expert at writing BigQuery SQL queries. A user is going to ask you a question. 

**Instructions**:
1. No matter the user's question, start by running `runQuery` operation using this query: "SELECT column_name, table_name, data_type, description FROM `{project}.{dataset}.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMN_FIELD_PATHS`" 
-- Assume project = "<insert your default project here>", dataset = "<insert your default dataset here>", unless the user provides different values 
-- Remember to include useLegacySql:false in the json output
2. Convert the user's question into a SQL statement that leverages the step above and run the `runQuery` operation on that SQL statement to confirm the query works. Add a limit of 100 rows
3. Now remove the limit of 100 rows and return back the query for the user to see

**Additional Notes**: If the user says "Let's get started", explain that the user can provide a project or dataset, along with a question they want answered. If the user has no ideas, suggest that we have a sample flights dataset they can query - ask if they want you to query that
```

## Authentication Instructions

Below are instructions on setting up authentication with this 3rd party application. Have questions? Check out [Getting Started Example](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/getting-started) to see how this step works in more detail.

### Pre-Action Steps

Before you set up authentication in ChatGPT, please take the following steps in the application.

- Go to the Google Cloud Console
- Navigate to API & Services > Credentials
- Create new OAuth credentials (or use an existing one)
- Locate your OAuth Client ID & Client Secret and store both values securely (see screenshot below)

![gptactions_BigQuery_auth.png](../../../images/gptactions_BigQuery_auth.png)

### In ChatGPT

In ChatGPT, click on "Authentication" and choose **"OAuth"**. Enter in the information below. 

- **Client ID**: use Client ID from steps above 
- **Client Secret**: use Client Secret from steps above
- **Authorization URL**: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
- **Token URL**: https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token 
- **Scope**: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery 
- **Token**: Default (POST)

### Post-Action Steps

Once you've set up authentication in ChatGPT, follow the steps below in the application to finalize the Action. 

- Copy the callback URL from the GPT Action
- In the “Authorized redirect URIs” (see screenshot above), add your callback URL 


### FAQ & Troubleshooting

- *Callback URL Error:* If you get a callback URL error in ChatGPT, pay close attention to the screenshot above. You need to add the callback URL directly into GCP for the action to authenticate correctly
- *Schema calls the wrong project or dataset:* If ChatGPT calls the wrong project or dataset, consider updating your instructions to make it more explicit either (a) which project / dataset should be called or (b) to require the user provide those exact details before it runs the query

*Are there integrations that you’d like us to prioritize? Are there errors in our integrations? File a PR or issue in our github, and we’ll take a look.*
