## Program of thought (CoT) prompting

Program of thought prompting, like chain of thought, for LLMs involves providing a sequence of reasoning steps in the prompt to guide the model toward a solution. This technique helps the model to process complex problems by breaking them down into intermediate steps, much like a human would. By mimicking human-like reasoning, chain of thought prompting improves the model's ability to handle tasks that require logic, deduction and programming. 

Let's look at a few of those examples below 👇 using DSPy Program of Thought (CoT) Module
[`dspy.ProgramOfThought`]. Most of this examples generate Python code to solve the problem.
To observe how the DSPy modules generate LLM prompts, you can inspect the history of the 
prompt generation, using `model.inspect_history(n=<value>)`

**Note**: 
To run any of these relevant notebooks you will need to install OLlama on the local
latop or use any LLM-hosted provder service: OpenAI, Anyscale Endpoints, Anthropic, etc.

    [1mQuestion:[0m
                What is the area of a triangle if its base is 4ft and height
                is 7ft?.
        
    The area of the triangle is 14.0 square feet.
    [1mAnswer  :[0mThe area of a triangle with base 4ft and height 7ft is 14.0 square feet. Here's the reasoning behind this:
    
    Question: What is the area of a triangle if its base is 4ft and height is 7ft?
    
    Code:
    ```python
    base = 4.0 # base in feet
    height = 7.0 # height in feet
    area = 0.5 * base * height
    print(f"The area of the triangle is {area} square feet.")
    ```
    
    Code Output: 14.0
    
    Reasoning: To find the area of a triangle, we can use the formula `area = (base * height) / 2`. In this case, we are given that the base is 4ft and the height is 7ft. So, we can substitute these values into the formula:
    ```python
    area = (base * height) / 2
    area = (4.0 * 7.0) / 2
    area = 14.0 / 2
    area *= 2
    answer = area
    print(f"The area of the triangle is {answer} square feet.")
    ```
    However, since we already have the value of `area` from the given code output, there's no need to calculate it again. The answer is simply the value of `area`, which is 14.0 square feet. Therefore, the final answer is:
    
    Answer: The area of a triangle with base 4ft and height 7ft is 14.0 square feet.

    [1mAnswer  :[0mQuestion: How to write a Python function to generate fibonacci series?
    
    Code:
    ```python
    def fibonacci(n):
        if n <= 0:
            return "Input should be positive integer"
        elif n == 1 or n == 2:
            return 1 if n == 1 else 0
        else:
            a, b = 0, 1
            for _ in range(n - 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
            return b
    ```
    
    Reasoning: To generate Fibonacci series using a Python function, we first check if the input `n` is valid. If it's less than or equal to zero, we return an error message. If it's 1 or 2, we return 1 since these are the base cases for the Fibonacci sequence. For larger values of `n`, we use a loop to calculate the Fibonacci series iteratively. We initialize two variables `a` and `b` to 0 and 1 respectively, and then in each iteration of the loop, we update `a` and `b` by swapping their values and adding the current value of `b` to the previous value of `a`. After the loop finishes, we return the final value of `b`, which is the desired Fibonacci number for the given input `n`.
    
    Answer: The provided Python function calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a loop instead of recursion. This implementation has a time complexity of O(n), making it more efficient than the recursive solution for larger values of `n`. Here's how you can use this function to generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers:
    ```python
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(fibonacci(i))
    ```
    This will output the following sequence: `1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55`.

    Question: How to write a Python function to generate fibonacci series?
    
    Code:
    def fibonacci(n):
        if n <= 0:
            return "Input should be positive integer"
        elif n == 1:
            return 0
        elif n == 2:
            return 1
        else:
            return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    
    Code Output: None
    
    Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to write a Python function to generate Fibonacci series. First, we need to define the base cases for the Fibonacci sequence, which are 0 and 1. The function should return 0 when `n` is 1 and 1 when `n` is 2. Next, we need to recursively calculate the Fibonacci series for larger values of `n`. We can do this by calling the function twice with arguments `n-1` and `n-2`, and then adding their results together. Here's the Python code that implements these steps: ```python def fibonacci(n): if n <= 0: return "Input should be positive integer" elif n == 1: return 0 elif n == 2: return 1 else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) ``` This function will generate the Fibonacci series for any positive integer input. However, it's important to note that this implementation has a time complexity of O(2^n), which is not very efficient for large values of `n`. A more efficient way to calculate Fibonacci numbers is by using dynamic programming or matrix exponentiation. Code Output: None (since we haven't run the code yet)
    
    Answer:[32m Question: How to write a Python function to generate fibonacci series?
    
    Code:

        else:

                a, b = b, a + b
            return b
    ```
    
    Reasoning: To generate Fibonacci series using a Python function, we first check if the input `n` is valid. If it's less than or equal to zero, we return an error message. If it's 1 or 2, we return 1 since these are the base cases for the Fibonacci sequence. For larger values of `n`, we use a loop to calculate the Fibonacci series iteratively. We initialize two variables `a` and `b` to 0 and 1 respectively, and then in each iteration of the loop, we update `a` and `b` by swapping their values and adding the current value of `b` to the previous value of `a`.

    Question: How to write Python code to find three smallest prime numbers greater than 30,000?
    
    Previous Code:
    def sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):
        primes = [True] * (limit + 1)
        p = 2
        while True:
            if not primes[p]:
                p += 1
                continue
            if p > limit:
                break
            for i in range(p*p, limit+1, p):
                primes[i] = False
            yield p
    
    three_smallest_primes = list(islice(sieve_of_eratosthenes(60000), 3))
    print(three_smallest_primes)
    
    Error: Evaluation of the code stopped at node 1. See: The variable `islice` is not defined.
    
    Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find three smallest prime numbers greater than 30,000 using Python. First, we need to understand that the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm generates all prime numbers up to a given limit. However, in this case, we only want the first three prime numbers that are greater than 30,000. To achieve this, we can modify the code as follows: 1. Generate all primes using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm up to a limit that is greater than the desired prime numbers. 2. Filter the list to keep only the prime numbers greater than 30,000. 3. Take the first three elements from the filtered list. Here's the corrected code: ```python def sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit): primes = [True] * (limit + 1) p = 2 while True: if not primes[p]: p += 1 continue if p > limit: break for i in range(p*p, limit+1, p): primes[i] = False yield p prime_numbers = list(sieve_of_eratosthenes(60005)) three_smallest_primes = [p for p in prime_numbers if p > 30000][:3] print(three_smallest_primes) ``` This code should work without any errors. It generates all prime numbers up to 60,005 (a limit greater than the desired prime numbers), filters the list to keep only the prime numbers greater than 30,000, and finally takes the first three elements from the filtered list.

For each iteration, we create a new fraction with the current number as the numerator and 1 as the denominator using the `fractions.Fraction()` constructor. Finally, we print out the generated fraction.[0m
