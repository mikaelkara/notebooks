# Kuzu

>[KÃ¹zu](https://kuzudb.com) is an embeddable property graph database management system built for query speed and scalability.
> 
> KÃ¹zu has a permissive (MIT) open source license and implements [Cypher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypher_(query_language)), a declarative graph query language that allows for expressive and efficient data querying in a property graph.
> It uses columnar storage and its query processor contains novel join algorithms that allow it to scale to very large graphs without sacrificing query performance.
> 
> This notebook shows how to use LLMs to provide a natural language interface to [KÃ¹zu](https://kuzudb.com) database with Cypher.

## Setting up

KÃ¹zu is an embedded database (it runs in-process), so there are no servers to manage.
Simply install it via its Python package:

```bash
pip install kuzu
```

Create a database on the local machine and connect to it:


```python
import kuzu

db = kuzu.Database("test_db")
conn = kuzu.Connection(db)
```

First, we create the schema for a simple movie database:


```python
conn.execute("CREATE NODE TABLE Movie (name STRING, PRIMARY KEY(name))")
conn.execute(
    "CREATE NODE TABLE Person (name STRING, birthDate STRING, PRIMARY KEY(name))"
)
conn.execute("CREATE REL TABLE ActedIn (FROM Person TO Movie)")
```




    <kuzu.query_result.QueryResult at 0x103a72290>



Then we can insert some data.


```python
conn.execute("CREATE (:Person {name: 'Al Pacino', birthDate: '1940-04-25'})")
conn.execute("CREATE (:Person {name: 'Robert De Niro', birthDate: '1943-08-17'})")
conn.execute("CREATE (:Movie {name: 'The Godfather'})")
conn.execute("CREATE (:Movie {name: 'The Godfather: Part II'})")
conn.execute(
    "CREATE (:Movie {name: 'The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone'})"
)
conn.execute(
    "MATCH (p:Person), (m:Movie) WHERE p.name = 'Al Pacino' AND m.name = 'The Godfather' CREATE (p)-[:ActedIn]->(m)"
)
conn.execute(
    "MATCH (p:Person), (m:Movie) WHERE p.name = 'Al Pacino' AND m.name = 'The Godfather: Part II' CREATE (p)-[:ActedIn]->(m)"
)
conn.execute(
    "MATCH (p:Person), (m:Movie) WHERE p.name = 'Al Pacino' AND m.name = 'The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone' CREATE (p)-[:ActedIn]->(m)"
)
conn.execute(
    "MATCH (p:Person), (m:Movie) WHERE p.name = 'Robert De Niro' AND m.name = 'The Godfather: Part II' CREATE (p)-[:ActedIn]->(m)"
)
```




    <kuzu.query_result.QueryResult at 0x103a9e750>



## Creating `KuzuQAChain`

We can now create the `KuzuGraph` and `KuzuQAChain`. To create the `KuzuGraph` we simply need to pass the database object to the `KuzuGraph` constructor.


```python
from langchain.chains import KuzuQAChain
from langchain_community.graphs import KuzuGraph
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
```


```python
graph = KuzuGraph(db)
```


```python
chain = KuzuQAChain.from_llm(
    llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"),
    graph=graph,
    verbose=True,
)
```

## Refresh graph schema information

If the schema of database changes, you can refresh the schema information needed to generate Cypher statements.
You can also display the schema of the KÃ¹zu graph as demonstrated below.


```python
# graph.refresh_schema()
```


```python
print(graph.get_schema)
```

    Node properties: [{'properties': [('name', 'STRING')], 'label': 'Movie'}, {'properties': [('name', 'STRING'), ('birthDate', 'STRING')], 'label': 'Person'}]
    Relationships properties: [{'properties': [], 'label': 'ActedIn'}]
    Relationships: ['(:Person)-[:ActedIn]->(:Movie)']
    
    

## Querying the graph

We can now use the `KuzuQAChain` to ask questions of the graph.


```python
chain.invoke("Who acted in The Godfather: Part II?")
```

## Use separate LLMs for Cypher and answer generation

You can specify `cypher_llm` and `qa_llm` separately to use different LLMs for Cypher generation and answer generation.


```python
chain = KuzuQAChain.from_llm(
    cypher_llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"),
    qa_llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4"),
    graph=graph,
    verbose=True,
)
```
