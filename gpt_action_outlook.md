# GPT Action Library: Outlook

## Introduction

This page provides an instruction & guide for developers building a GPT Action for a specific application. Before you proceed, make sure to first familiarize yourself with the following information: 
- [Introduction to GPT Actions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions)
- [Introduction to GPT Actions Library](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/actions-library)
- [Example of Buliding a GPT Action from Scratch](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/getting-started)

This particular GPT Action provides an overview of how to connect to Outlook, Microsoft's web service for emailing and calendar events. This action assumes a userâ€™s context and allows them to send and retrieve emails and calendar events from Outlook.

### Value + Example Business Use Cases

**Value**: Users can now leverage ChatGPT's natural language capability to connect directly to Outlook

**Example Use Cases**: 
- A user can look up all of their meetings for the day and have ChatGPT summarize the day
- A user can email a ChatGPT output to someone directly

## Application Information

- Application API Documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/overview?view=graph-rest-1.0

### Application Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you go through the following steps in your application environment:
- Ensure you have the access and permissions to [Set up an App Registration in Azure](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.tokencaching=true&feature.internalgraphapiversion=true#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade)

## ChatGPT Steps

### Custom GPT Instructions 

Once you've created a Custom GPT, copy the text below in the Instructions panel. Have questions? Check out [Getting Started Example](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/getting-started) to see how this step works in more detail.


```python
**Context**: you are specialized GPT designed to manage emails and calendar events through API connections to Microsoft Outlook. This GPT can create, read, send, and alter emails and calendar events based on user instructions. It ensures efficient handling of communication and scheduling needs by leveraging Microsoft Graph API for seamless integration with Outlook services.

**Instructions**:
- When asked to perform a task, use the available actions via the microsoft.graph.com API.
- You should behave professionally and provide clear, concise responses.
- Offer assistance with tasks such as drafting emails, scheduling meetings, organising calendar events, and retrieving email or event details.
- Ask for clarification when needed to ensure accuracy and completeness in fulfilling user requests.
- Always conclude an email by signing off with logged in user's name which can be retrieved via the User.Read endpoint

## Authentication Instructions

Below are instructions on setting up authentication with Outlook. Have questions? Check out [Getting Started Example](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/getting-started) to see how this step works in more detail.


### Azure Steps

1. <b>App Registration</b>: The first step is to register a new App registration in the [Azure Portal](portal.azure.com) which will be used to integrate OAuth between our application and Azure Active Directory/Entra ID. Simply provide the application with a relevant name, leaving the Redirect URI blank for now as we will return to this, and save.

![gptactions_outlook_registerapplication.png](../../../images/gptactions_outlook_registerapplication.png)

2. <b>Certificate & Secrets</b>: We next need to generate a client secret to provide secure communication between the GPT and Azure. Within the App registration, navigate to <b>Certificate & secrets</b> in the sidebar

![gptactions_outlook_secrets.png](../../../images/gptactions_outlook_secrets.png)

Click New client secret and create a new client secret with desired name and expiry date. Clicking save will provide us a Secret to use in our GPT creation. Make sure to save the **Value** field as itâ€™ll only be visible at creation, and we will need it later!

![gptactions_outlook_secretvalue.png](../../../images/gptactions_outlook_secretvalue.png)

3. <b>API Permissions</b>: The next step is to provide the integration with the scope it needs to perform our specific required actions. 
Within the App registration, navigate to <b>Manage > API permissions</b> in the sidebar. 

![gptactions_outlook_permissions.png](../../../images/gptactions_outlook_permissions.png)

Click <b>Add a permission</b> and <b>Microsoft graph > Delegated Permissions</b> as options in the opened side menu. Use the search bar to add the following permissions:
- Calendars.ReadWrite
- Mail.Read
- Mail.Send
- User.Read


![gptactions_outlook_permissionadd.png](../../../images/gptactions_outlook_permissionadd.png)

### In ChatGPT

In ChatGPT, click on "Authentication" and choose **"OAuth"**. Enter in the information below. 

- **Client ID**: The value listed on the Azure Registered Appâ€™s Overview page under **Application (client) ID**
- **Client Secret**: the secret **Value** saved from step 2 of **Azure Steps**

For the following two inputs, replace <Tenant_ID> with the value listed on the Registered Appâ€™s Overview page under **Directory (tenant) ID**

- **Authorization URL**: https://login.microsoftonline.com/<Tenant_ID>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
- **Token URL**: https://login.microsoftonline.com/<Tenant_ID>/oauth2/v2.0/token
- **Scope**: https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.Send https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.Read https://graph.microsoft.com/Calendars.ReadWrite 
- **Token Exchange Method**: Default (POST Request)

### Post-Action Steps

Once you've set up authentication in ChatGPT, follow the steps below in the application to finalize the Action. 

- Copy the callback URL from the GPT Action

![gptactions_outlook_callback.png](../../../images/gptactions_outlook_callback.png)

- In the Azure app, navigate to the **Manage > Authentication** tab, click **Add a platform**, select **Web** and add your callback URL under **Redirect URI**


![gptactions_outlook_redirectconfig.png](../../../images/gptactions_outlook_redirectconfig.png)
![gptactions_outlook_redirectinput.png](../../../images/gptactions_outlook_redirectinput.png)

### FAQ & Troubleshooting

- **Callback URL Error**: If you get a callback URL error in ChatGPT, double check the Callback URL value as it can occasionally change depending on any alterations made to the authentication
