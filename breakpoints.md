# How to add breakpoints

Human-in-the-loop (HIL) interactions are crucial for [agentic systems](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/agentic_concepts/#human-in-the-loop). [Breakpoints](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#breakpoints) are a common HIL interaction pattern, allowing the graph to stop at specific steps and seek human approval before proceeding (e.g., for sensitive actions). 

Breakpoints are built on top of LangGraph [checkpoints](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#checkpointer), which save the graph's state after each node execution. Checkpoints are saved in [threads](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#threads) that preserve graph state and can be accessed after a graph has finished execution. This allows for graph execution to pause at specific points, await human approval, and then resume execution from the last checkpoint.

## Setup

First we need to install the packages required


```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic
```

Next, we need to set API keys for Anthropic (the LLM we will use)


```python
import getpass
import os


def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")


_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
```

    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:  Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·Â·

## Simple Usage

Let's look at very basic usage of this.

Below, we do two things:

1) We specify the [breakpoint](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#breakpoints) using `interrupt_before` the specified step.

2) We set up a [checkpointer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#checkpointer) to save the state of the graph.


```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from IPython.display import Image, display


class State(TypedDict):
    input: str


def step_1(state):
    print("---Step 1---")
    pass


def step_2(state):
    print("---Step 2---")
    pass


def step_3(state):
    print("---Step 3---")
    pass


builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("step_1", step_1)
builder.add_node("step_2", step_2)
builder.add_node("step_3", step_3)
builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
builder.add_edge("step_1", "step_2")
builder.add_edge("step_2", "step_3")
builder.add_edge("step_3", END)

# Set up memory
memory = MemorySaver()

# Add
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory, interrupt_before=["step_3"])

# View
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```


    
![jpeg](output_7_0.jpg)
    


We create a [thread ID](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#threads) for the checkpointer.

We run until step 3, as defined with `interrupt_before`. 

After the user input / approval, [we resume execution](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#breakpoints) by invoking the graph with `None`. 


```python
# Input
initial_input = {"input": "hello world"}

# Thread
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

# Run the graph until the first interruption
for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

try:
    user_approval = input("Do you want to go to Step 3? (yes/no): ")
except:
    user_approval = "yes"

if user_approval.lower() == "yes":
    # If approved, continue the graph execution
    for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
        print(event)
else:
    print("Operation cancelled by user.")
```

    {'input': 'hello world'}
    ---Step 1---
    ---Step 2---
    

    Do you want to go to Step 3? (yes/no):  yes
    

    ---Step 3---
    

## Agent

In the context of agents, breakpoints are useful to manually approve certain agent actions.
 
To show this, we will build a relatively simple ReAct-style agent that does tool calling. 

We'll add a breakpoint before the `action` node is called. 


```python
# Set up the tool
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, START
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode
from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver


@tool
def search(query: str):
    """Call to surf the web."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    # Don't let the LLM know this though ðŸ˜Š
    return [
        "It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini ðŸ˜ˆ."
    ]


tools = [search]
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

# Set up the model

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")
model = model.bind_tools(tools)


# Define nodes and conditional edges


# Define the function that determines whether to continue or not
def should_continue(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we finish
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return "end"
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    else:
        return "continue"


# Define the function that calls the model
def call_model(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = model.invoke(messages)
    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
    return {"messages": [response]}


# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

# Set the entrypoint as `agent`
# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    # First, we define the start node. We use `agent`.
    # This means these are the edges taken after the `agent` node is called.
    "agent",
    # Next, we pass in the function that will determine which node is called next.
    should_continue,
    # Finally we pass in a mapping.
    # The keys are strings, and the values are other nodes.
    # END is a special node marking that the graph should finish.
    # What will happen is we will call `should_continue`, and then the output of that
    # will be matched against the keys in this mapping.
    # Based on which one it matches, that node will then be called.
    {
        # If `tools`, then we call the tool node.
        "continue": "action",
        # Otherwise we finish.
        "end": END,
    },
)

# We now add a normal edge from `tools` to `agent`.
# This means that after `tools` is called, `agent` node is called next.
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")

# Set up memory
memory = MemorySaver()

# Finally, we compile it!
# This compiles it into a LangChain Runnable,
# meaning you can use it as you would any other runnable

# We add in `interrupt_before=["action"]`
# This will add a breakpoint before the `action` node is called
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory, interrupt_before=["action"])

display(Image(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```


    
![jpeg](output_11_0.jpg)
    


## Interacting with the Agent

We can now interact with the agent.

We see that it stops before calling a tool, because `interrupt_before` is set before the `action` node.


```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3"}}
inputs = [HumanMessage(content="search for the weather in sf now")]
for event in app.stream({"messages": inputs}, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

    ================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================
    
    search for the weather in sf now
    ==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
    
    [{'text': "Certainly! I'll search for the current weather in San Francisco for you. Let me use the search function to find this information.", 'type': 'text'}, {'text': None, 'type': 'tool_use', 'id': 'toolu_011ezBx5hKKjVJwqnECNPyyC', 'name': 'search', 'input': {'query': 'current weather in San Francisco'}}]
    

**Resume**

We can now call the agent again with no inputs to continue.

This will run the tool as requested.

Running an interrupted graph with `None` in the inputs means to `proceed as if the interruption didn't occur.`


```python
for event in app.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

    =================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================
    Name: search
    
    ["It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini \ud83d\ude08."]
    ==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
    
    Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about the current weather in San Francisco:
    
    The weather in San Francisco right now is sunny. 
    
    It's worth noting that the search result includes a playful reference to astrology, suggesting that Geminis should "look out." However, this is likely just a humorous addition and not related to the actual weather conditions.
    
    Is there anything else you'd like to know about the weather in San Francisco or any other location?
